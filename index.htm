        <h3>JSON Formatter and Code Beautify Data Leaks</h3>
        <p>
            You would have thought in the current climate of security consciousness that users would have enough savvy to not just blindly paste information into 
            websites online that reformat and provide that information back on an open-access link, but you'd be wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the continuing case of &quot;finding new ways to exfiltrate data by oblivious stupidity&quot;, years of corporate data has been found to have leaked (and remains) 
            on the online tool sites JSONformatter and CodeBeautify. Cybersecurity company watchTowr Labs <a href="https://labs.watchtowr.com/stop-putting-your-passwords-into-random-website" target="watchTowrWin">captured a dataset</a> of over 80,000 files which contained: usernames and passwords; 
            repository authentication keys; Active Directory, Database and FTP credentials; Cloud keys; LDAP configuration inforamtion; helpdesk API keys; meeting room API keys; SSH session 
            recordings and all manner of personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, just a few items of interest, then.
        </p>
        <p>
            One might consider that the data might be limited to developers running some early-doors testing, however the companies affected span critical national infrastructure, 
            government, finance, insurance, banking, technology, retail, aerospace, telecommunications, healthcare, education, travel and cybersecurity sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, let's just say, the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            In modern news there is so much emphasis placed on elite hackers breaking through tiny cracks in firewalls or security systems whilst a simple script run across online tooling 
            can provide more data readily availale. This isn't so much a back door as a thousand acre farm with an &quot;Open All Hours&quot; neon sign at the open entrance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Excuse me, I'm off to rotate all my corporate and personal data in case someone thought it was useful to paste bin my life...

        <h3>U.S. Worker guilty of sabotage on ex-employer</h3>
        <p>
            A U.S. worker in Ohio has pleaded guilty of sabotaging his ex-employer's computer systems causing $862,000 worth of damage. The 35-year old contractor, 
            Maxwell Shultz, impersonated another contractor to operate powershell scripts and attempt to cover his tracks by removing logs after being 
            fired from the unnamed company.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scripts reset the passwords to around 2,500 accounts on the system and caused the stated damage cost in downtime, disruption to customer services and 
            remediation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Maxwell will be sentenced at the end of January, facing up to ten years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet another case of disgruntled employees with too much access to systems highlights the need to have sanitation routines on passwords, keys and systems when 
            offboarding employees with wide-ranging access.

        <h3>Chrome Zero Day Vulnerability</h3>
        <p>
           Google have announced a critical patch required for Chrome with a <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13223" target="ChromeWin">0-day in the wild</a> targeting the 
           JavaScript V8 engine. The vulnerability can lead to a crafted web page crashing or running code on your machine, so updating to the latest version should be on your 
           priority list.
        </p>
        <p>
            A second, &quot;no exploits reported&quot; emergency patch for V8 JavaScript is also bundled into the update. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This will be the seventh 0-day in Chrome this year, at a time when known nation-state linked groups are actively abusing 0-day exploits in their attack vectors.

        <h3>Claude AI used for cyber espionage</h3>
        <p>
           In a <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf">security report from Anthropic</a>  the first catalogued usage of AI tools 
           to attempt access to over thirty high-profile companies and government organisations. In some cases, the attacks was successful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traced-back to a Chinese state-sponsored group, the attackers used Claude Code and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to run the attacks without a human in the tactical execution loop. 
            A human-developed framework utilised Claude to orchestrate multi-stage attacks, which were then in-turn carried out by several Claude sub-agents, all performing specific tasks. 
            Once the sub-agents had developed exploit chains and their associated custom payloads, human operators spent between two and ten minutes reviewing the results of the AI's actions, then signing-off on the subsequent exploitations.
            The sub-agents ran to find and validate credentials, escalate privileges, moving laterally across the network, accessing and then stealing sensitive data. Post-exploitation, the human operator only had to again review the AI's 
            work before approving the final data exfiltration.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;While we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale&quot; states Anthropic's new analysis. As with standard AI, it &quot;requently overstated findings and occasionally 
            fabricated data during autonomous operations&quot;. So, it's not just normal development teams suffering from the cocky and erroneous &quot;I'm amazing!&quot; responses from AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            It may be the first documented case, but with the rise of automated systems it is unlikely to be the solitary example in the news.

        <h3>Cisco Firewall Ongoing Attacks</h3>
        <p>
           Continuing on from the previous Cisco vulnerability in the wild reports, Cisco have uncovered an ongoing attack against Secure ASA Software or Cisco 
           Secure FTD Software releases affected by CVE-2025-20333 and CVE-2025-20362.
        </p>
        <p>
            The CVE's, which were patched in September after Cisco worked for several months with government agencies to investigate attacks on equipment, can lead 
            to equipment being forced in a reboot cycle. In some cases, the ROMmon has been modified to estblish persistent connections to equipment even after rebooting 
            or software upgrades.
        </p>
        <p>
            The advice is clear and urgent - patch now. Cisco have more details on their <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/asa_ftd_continued_attacks" target="CiscoWin">security advisory</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco also notified customers that they have discovered two critical security holes in the contact centre software, tracked as CVE-2025-20354 and CVE-2025-20358. They affect Cisco Unified CCX, regardless of device configuration 
            and allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files; execute commands with root privileges; or bypass authentication to run scripts as a non-root user.
        </p>
        <p>
            In plain terms, if you can't patch your systems, consider the hardware compromised or compromisable. If you have the ability, patch everything right now - turn off features or replace ageing equipment.

        <h3>Canadian Infrastructure Hack</h3>
        <p>
            The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security <a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/alerts-advisories/al25-016-internet-accessible-industrial-control-systems-ics-abused-hacktivists" target="CanadaWin">issued an alert</a> to raise 
            awareness of a cyber threat impacting critical infrastructure across Canada. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hacktivists have managed to breach municipal water facility systems along with an Oil and Gas company. In an effort to raise awareness of their own cause, the Hacktivists tampered with 
            settings and guage readings at facilities, thankfully not causing major incidents or injury/death. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security warns that the attack highlights the failings to secure critical national infrastructure, with the usual suspects of Internet connected systems that 
            are vulnerable, open, or not adequately patched. PLC's, remote terminal units, human-machine interfaces, SCADA systems, safety controllers, building management setups and other IoT equipment 
            left exposed and open to tamper from anyone on the Internet. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Companies providing critical infrastructure and services must take stock of their systems and access points into the equipment they operate, or the next time it might not be 
            a Hacktivist group raising awareness, but a nation state taking-out adversaries.

        <h3>Docker Vulnerabilties</h3>
        <p>
            Another day, another set of patching to undertake on your development systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            A new vulnerability in Docker Compose (CVE-2025-62725) has been given an 8.9 severity rating. Uncovered by Imperva's Ron Masas, the path-traversal 
            vulnerability allows attackers to escape Compose's cache directory and write arbitrary files onto the host system. The vulnerability comes through a 
            recently added support for OCI-based Compose artifacts. Users are recommended to upgrade to v2.40.2 of Docker Compose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Docker has also fixed a flaw in the Windows installer that left it vulnerabile to DLL injection. ENISA tracked the issue as EUVD-2025-36191 with an 8.8 rating. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The flaw in the installer allowed SLL hijacking due to insecure DLL search orders - at a time when DLL hijacking and injection has been a favourite of cybercriminal groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Patched in Desktop 4.49.0, users are encouraged to upgrade if they haven't already. The release notes also warn the next release onwards requires at least Windows 10 22H2 or Windows 11 23H2 
            which could impact users on certain patch cycles.

        <h3>European Telco Compromised</h3>
        <p>
            The research team at Darktrace have uncovered activity in a European telecommunications organisation (currently no name shared) that matches 
            patterns with the China-linked cyber espionage group Salt Typhoon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nathaniel Jones, Darktrace's vice president of security and AI strategy and field CISO along with Sam Lister, specialist security researcher at Darktrace 
            published a blog post detailing some of the insights gained: &quot;The intrusion likely began with the exploitation of a Citrix NetScaler Gateway appliance 
            in early July 2025... from there, the actor pivoted to Citrix Virtual Delivery Agent hosts in the client's Machine Creation Services subnet.... Initial access 
            activities in the intrusion originated from an endpoint potentially associated with the SoftEther VPN service, suggesting infrastructure obfuscation from the outset&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Darktrace observed the threat actor delivering a backdoor likely to be SNAPPYBEE to multiple Citrix VDA hosts, delivered as a DLL alongside legitimate 
            executable files for antivirus software such as Norton and Bkav and IObit Malware Fighter.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The Salt Typhoon group has a record of persistently evading detection while maintaining access to sensitive environments using a range of obfuscation techniques and 
            zero-day exploits. It serves as a constant reminder to patch early and employ proactive, intelligence-driven defense strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not the first telecommunications provider that the group has gone after and exploited and it is unlikely to be the last.

        <h3>F5 Compromised</h3>
        <p>
            US security company, F5, has <a href="https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000154696" target="F5win">issued a statement</a> stating it has had their systems 
            compromised and data exfiltrated. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The information taken from their systems includes a portion of the BIG-IP software codebase and vulnerability information which could lead to 
            discovery of exploits in the hardware and software provided by F5. Affected Hardware F5 products include: BIG-IP iSeries, rSeries, or any other F5 device that has reached end of support, 
            with software affected including all devices running BIG-IP (F5OS), BIG-IP (TMOS), Virtual Edition (VE), BIG IP Next, BIG- IQ, and BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes (BNK) / Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNF)
        </p>
        <p>
            F5 states: <br/>
            &quot;...we learned a highly sophisticated nation-state threat actor maintained long-term, persistent access to, and downloaded files from, certain F5 systems. These systems included our BIG-IP product development environment and engineering knowledge management platforms...&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;We have no evidence of access to, or exfiltration of, data from our CRM, financial, support case management, or iHealth systems. However, some of the exfiltrated files from our knowledge management platform contained configuration or implementation information for a small 
            percentage of customers. We are currently reviewing these files and will be communicating with affected customers directly as appropriate.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            In a change to recent global patterns of compromise, this doesn't appear to be a supply-chain attack and from their assessment appears to be a very targeted attack aimed at gaining knowledge on 
            the BIG-IP software from F5. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Management interfaces customers may have exposed to the Internet should be switced-off and the latest updates applied to systems. It is likely that F5 systems will be targeted increasingly and any 
            attack surface open to the world will be prodded to discover possible weaknesses, therefore F5 have advised utilisation of SIEM tooling to monitor activity to and from your devices.

        <p>
            You put your hack crew in, you take your hack crew out, in out, in out, rattle sabres all about...
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, the hokey cokey... they're in they're out, they're back, they're scattering into the dark... it's the unusual and confusing world 
            of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters group where they come out of retirement to head back into it again. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems the group are having some tête-à-tête with the FBI after recent high-level attacks on systems and subsequent arrests and investigations. Formed 
            as an amalgamation of key members from Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and Shiny Hunters, the group has come under scrutiny again due to recent data drops from companies including Qantas, 
            Vietnam Airlines, Gap, and Fujifilm.
        </p>
        <p>
            The group stated in their usual &lt;sarcasm&gt;charming&lt;/sarcasm&gt; way:<br/>
            &quot;As per the exceptional circumstances by which the FBI tried to obliterate our legacy, we've exceptionally decided to

            As with all of the groups, there will be internal politics and power struggles along with grudges against agencies and personnel. How this plays out over 
            the next few months will be seen in time, but for now, perhaps, maybe, possibly, they're hiding in the dark corners again - watching, waiting, listening..

        <h3>Discord Information leaked</h3>
        <p>
            Well, well, well, if it isn't the consequences of enforced age verification decisions coming back to bite you... brace for more of this over the coming 
            weeks, months and years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discord has said around 70,000 users have had their data potentially leaked by a company that was contracted to undertake age verification. The 
            information leaked includes photographs for age verification, personal details, support team chat information and partial credit card details. So just 
            a few things to be concerned about.
        </p>
        <p>
            Affected users have been contacted by Discord and the (surprise, surprise) third-party that was connected to Discord's systems has had access removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again we see the side-chain attack in full flow with outsourced support companies failing in their duty to protect information. The list of companies 
            affected by this type of attack is growing daily.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the requirement for age verification firmly in place on many services, there is a need for the service providers to step-up their security. The 
            rush to implement providers will undoubtedly have led to cost saving at the detriment to security.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's see what the actual toll is on Discord and which provider will be the next leaky bucket.

        <h3>Metropolitan Police arrest suspected nursery group hackers</h3>
        <p>
            The Metropolitan Police have confirmed they have arrested two 17-year-old individuals in the ongoing investigation into the 
            Kido chain nursery hack that saw the names, addresses and photographs of children and their parents stolen in late September.
        </p>
        <p>
            The hackers initially demanded a ransom of around £600,000 in Bitcoin to not release the details and began a campaign of contacting 
            parents in the list to have them pressurise the nursery chain. When ransom money was seen to be not forthcoming the hackers began to 
            publish the images and addresses of children in their data. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If not already calous enough in setting a nursery as a target, this act of seems to have tipped the scales heavily against the criminals 
            with the group suddenly blurring imagery on their site seemingly worried about negative reputation with other hacker groups. 
        </p>
        <p>
           On the 2nd October the hackers suddenly removed all the stolen data and pictures from their site, claiming to have deleted all 8,000 files stating &quot;No more remains and this can comfort parents&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
           Was it external pressure from other groups, concern over the backlash in the media or some flake of moral concern? As yet we'll have to speculate.
        </p>
        <p>
           The Metropolitan Police confirmed the hackers were arrested at residential addresses in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, on suspicion of computer misuse and blackmail. The investigation continues.

        <h3>OpenAI boots suspected Chinese Gov accounts from ChatGPT</h3>
        <p>
            OpenAI published an <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/threat-intelligence-reports/7d662b68-952f-4dfd-a2f2-fe55b041cc4a/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai-october-2025.pdf" target="openAIwin">intelligence report</a> 
            stating it has banned ChatGPT accounts it believes to be linked to Chinese government entities attempting to use AI models to generate 
            surveillance software.
        </p>
        <p>
            The users, now banned, were suspected to be utilising a VPN service to access the AI software from China. In one account, their requests to the AI models  
            were seen to be asking it to design promotional materials and project plans for a social media listening tool, described as a &quot;probe&quot; that could 
            scan X, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok and YouTube for what the user described as extermist speech, ethnic, religious and political content.
        </p>
        <p>
            The principal investigator on OpenAI's intelligence and investigations team said 
            &quot;What we saw and banned in those cases was typically threat actors asking ChatGPT to help put together plans or documentation for AI-powered tools, but not then to implement them.&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company also banned one user who asked ChatGPT to identify funding sources for an X account that criticised the Chinese government, and another who asked ChatGPT to identify organizers of a petition in Mongolia
        </p>
        <p>
            Michael Flossman, who leads OpenAI's threat intelligence team said &quot;One China-linked cluster that we investigated, for example, used ChatGPT to draft phishing lures and then explored another model, DeepSeek, to automate mass targeting,&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
           China isn't alone in being banned as OpenAI has also seen system abuse originating from Russia asking the model to develop and refine malware, including remote access tojans, 
           credential stealers and features to help malware evade detection.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI is a growing concern for data exfiltration and as a weaponised tool allowing those who would normally be incapable of generating malware and campaigns the means to 
            quickly and easily generate systems. We can only hope that the teams continue to implement stronger guard-rails and keep on top of security issues as we get to grips with 
            the automated future we've released on ourselves.

        <h3>Malicious Python Package</h3>
        <p>
            A malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository has been caught and removed, but downloaded 2653 times since it appeared on the 26th September. 
            Claiming to offer a SOCKS5 proxy service, it included malicious functionality to provide stealthy backdoors to Windows to enable the drop of additional payloads 
            onto the machine.
        </p>
        <p>
            JFrog's security research team provided a <a href="https://research.jfrog.com/post/check-your-socks-a-deep-dive-into-soopsocks-pypi/" target="JFROGWin">full breakdown of the package</a> citing:
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;The SoopSocks PyPI package (XRAY-725599) promises to create a SOCKS5 proxy service and report information about the server to a configurable Discord webhook, supporting fallback as a 
            scheduled task. While providing this capability it exhibits behaviour as a Backdoor proxy server, targeting Windows platforms, using automated installation processes via VBScript or 
            an executable version.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The malicious package included privilege escalation and reconnaissance capabilities, making it a danger to developer systems and servers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The team reported the package to maintainers after their analysis, and it was subsequently removed from PyPI on Sep 29, 18:00 GMT+3.

        <h3>Cisco Vulnerbility Actively Exploited</h3>
        <p>
            The recently disclosed Cisco Vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-20333 and CVE-2025-20362) allowing access to endpoints and execution of code is now 
            being actively exploited to deploy malware components such as LINE VIPER and RayInitiator, the 
            <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/persistent-malicious-targeting-cisco-devices" target="NCSCWin">NCSC have stated</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco have warned vendors that &quot;"Attackers were observed to have exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities and employed advanced evasion techniques such as disabling logging, intercepting CLI commands, 
            and intentionally crashing devices to prevent diagnostic analysis&quot;. There have been noted incidents where ROMMON has been modified to persist modifications after a reboot or software update.
        </p>
        <p>
            ASA 5500-X Series models running Cisco ASA Software releases 9.12 or 9.14 with VPN web services enabled, and which do not support Secure Boot and Trust Anchor technologies have been compromised 
            in this latest vulnerability attack. All of the affected devices have reached end-of-support (EoS) or are about to reach EoS status by next week including:<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>5512-X</li>
                <li>5515-X</li>
                <li>5525-X</li>
                <li>5545-X</li>
                <li>5555-X</li>
                <li>5585-X</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            NCSC are urging network vendors to verify their traffic and systems, remediate through patching and potentially replace anything that is heading to EoL. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;It is critical for organisations to take note of the recommended actions highlighted by Cisco today, particularly on detection and remediation&quot;, said 
            Ollie Whitehouse, the NCSC CTO. &quot;We strongly encourage network defenders to follow vendor best practices and engage with the NCSC's malware analysis report to assist with their investigations.<br/>
            End-of-life technology presents a significant risk for organisations. Systems and devices should be promptly migrated to modern versions to address vulnerabilities and strengthen resilience.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the wide usage of the devices it is likely that we'll see an increase in compromise reports over the coming weeks.

        <h3>European Airport Hacker Nabbed by NCA</h3>
        <p>
            The National Crime Agency have arrested a man in West Sussex in connection with the European airport system hack that brought air travel to 
            a grinding halt at the weekend and continues to cause issues into this week.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attack against the Collins Aerospace technology check-in system caused widespread issues, travel problems and delays across Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Officers from the NCA supported by the regional crimes unit arrested the man in his 40's on Tuesday evening on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences. 
            He has subsequently been released on conditional bail.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing.&quot; said NCA deputy director, 
            Paul Foster (head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit). &quot;Cybercrime is a persistent global threat that continues to cause significant disruption to the UK. 
            Alongside our partners here and overseas, the NCA is committed to reducing that threat in order to protect the British public&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The investigation into the inicident continues with no specific cybercriminal gang claiming responsibility for the action as yet. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As reiterated many times over the course of recent incidents, this sort of attack will continue and persistently prove that infrastructure is vulnerable to outside 
            influences and attack. We will no doubt hear of further results from the investigation in due course.

        <h3>European Airport Check-in System Hacked</h3>
        <p>
            Airlines have been pushed into chaos this weekend with flights delayed due to centralised software, Muse, which is operated by RTX (who owns software provider Collins Aerospace) 
            enduring a &quot;cyber-related disruption&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations.&quot; RTX commented. Customers trying to 
            meet connections have found the delays have hindered or cancelled their ongoing journeys.
        </p>
        <p>
            Heathrow, Dublin and several other airports have had to delay flights and switch to manual check-in processes to try to keep the lines of customers moving. In several airports customers 
            have been left stranded as flights are delayed, rescheduled or cancelled and journeys put on hold.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than noting the software affected, Collins Aerospace have yet to comment publicly about the nature or origin of the hack, leaving speculation as to the cause ranging from 
            ransomware to the loss of access to systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the recent incursion into foreign airspace by Russia this week, there is a heightened nervousness around the origin of this incident.

            Chrome has had a high severity patch pushed by Google which is under active exploitation. If you haven't already, now is the time to run updates in your 
            browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flaw in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, tracked as CVE-2025-10585, is a type confusion bug where the engine misinterprets a block of memory 
            as one type of object when it's actually something else. This flaw can lead to system crashes, arbitrary code execution, and when chained with other outstanding issues, 
            potential full system compromise via a malicious HTML page.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flaw was discovered and reported by the Google Threat Analysis Group and a patch for Windows, Apple and Linux environments is available now.

        <h3>TfL Hackers Charged</h3>
        <p>
            The National Crime Agency (NCA) in the UK <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/two-charged-for-tfl-cyber-attack" target="NCAWin">have announced</a> 
            that two men have been charged for the Transport for London (TfL) network intrusion on the 31st August 2024, believed to have been carried out by members of Scattered Spider.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thalha Jubair (19) and Owen Flowers (18) were arrested at their home addresses on Tuesday 16th September and appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court on the 18th 
            September after the Crown Prosecution Service authorised they be charged with conspiring together to commit unauthorised acts against TfL under the Computer Misuse Act.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flowers was initially arrested for the TfL attack on the 6th September 2024, whereby NCA officers identified further potential evidence of offences against US healthcare companies. 
            Flowers has therefore been also charged with conspiring with others to infiltrate and damage the networks of SSM Health Care Corporation and attempting to do the same to 
            Sutter Health's networks, both in the U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jubair has been additionally charged under RIPA for failing to disclose the pin or passwords for devices seized from him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both individuals will appear at the Crown Court on the 16th October 2025. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hannah Von Dadelszen, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS said:<br/>
            &quot;The Crown Prosecution Service has decided to prosecute Thalha Jubair and Owen Flowers with computer misuse and fraud related charges - following a National Crime Agency 
            investigation into a cyber-attack on the Transport for London network. Our prosecutors have worked to establish that there is sufficient evidence to bring the case to trial and that 
            it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings. We have worked closely with the National Crime Agency as they carried out their investigation.&quot;

            The codebase is a <strong>quick and dirty hack</strong>, so don't start hosting it on external endpoints as I've not run any testing against it and I know there's some older packages on there.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will need to generate your own SBOM files before using the process, there's a bunch of tooling to provide that for you available online. Once you have that, then throw the sbom at the searcher.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyhow... there we have it. This was a week that was. I'm sure there will be plenty more weeks like this in the months and years ahead. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Stay safe out there, friends.

        <h3>NPM SBoM Check</h3>
        <p>
            The ever growing <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/ongoing-supply-chain-attack-targets-crowdstrike-npm-packages" target="SocketWin">list of compromised NPM packages</a> (thank you, Socket, for tracking this!) 
            is causing a pain to keep up with alongside work, and despite having a nice SBoM output from my dev teams, trying to manually keep up with checking was somewhat of a manual headache... especially after a huge deluge 
            of compromised items into the list.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cue several hours of scraping data from the 'net and some janky dev work on my side... 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've pulled together a very quick and dirty system with worker functions and a web interface to help keep track of my system status. With the ability to throw a CSV of new entries at it every few hours as I need to it's certainly easier 
            than manually entering data to search through the SBoM output from our systems. It's been a while since I've had to do this type of frantic dev in anger while holding down the other daily tasks to support teams, 
            but it's working (!) and providing some feedback on the company codebase, so .. yay.. win for the old man with rusty skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            I might end up forking a version of my code, tidying it a bit and providing on Github if this worm continues to help others in the same situation (be gentle, I'm tired and juggling way too much!).
        </p>
        <p>
            I admit this whole situation feels reminiscent of dealing with the early 2000's worms at the beginning of my career in I.T. As with any worm the damn thing will keep popping up on unsuspecting developer machines and making it's way around. 
            I suspect that this will linger around for quite some time, causing a headache for development, security and operational teams. There is much to learn from the incident and the nasty attack patterns it's using (the pushing to your own Github 
            repos and marking private/internal repos as public is a high-level concern for me right now), with another &quot;we have to stop using long-term auth tokens&quot; comment hanging above the whole episode for package systems around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Is anyone else frantically writing janky tooling for this at the moment ? I would imagine I'm not the only one hammering the keyboard and trying to work out ways of dealing with this type of attack.

        <h3>Another Day, Another NPM Supply Chain Attack</h3>
        <p>
            Ah yes, it's another day ending in &quot;y&quot; so it must be time for another NPM supply chain attack. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Today's list of affected NPM packages is <a href="https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised#affected-packages" target="StepSecurity">quite extensive</a> and includes some code (bundle.js injected into each package) that tries to search for credentials by pulling and using TruffleHog. A great rundown was 
            provided by <a href="https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised" target="StepSecurity">Step Security</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The new compromise is much more convoluted, and has self-propagation included to further infect packages of the maintainer utilising the infected package. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet another day that I'm having to run scanning of my company software bill of materials lists. Stay safe out there - I'm expecting more of the same as time passes with increasingly 
            complex malware bundled into the supply chain.

        <h3>Cybercrime groups down tools (for now)</h3>
        <p>
            In a post to <a href="https://breachforums.hn/" target="BreachWin">Breachforums</a>, fifteen of the more known cybercriminal groups including Scattered Spider and Lapsus$ have announced they are going dark. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The announcement comes after a season of high-level intrusions into a range of companies such as Air France, Marks &amp; Spencer and Jaguar to name but three. In recent months 
            a number of arrests have been made in relation to the groups with no update on the investigation as yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Citing that &quot;Our objectives having been fulfilled, it is now time to say goodbye.&quot; and further, &quot;The most stupid ... will enjoy our golden parachutes with the millions the group accumulated. 
            Others will keep on studying and improving systems you use in your daily lives. In silence. Others finally will just go gentle into that good night.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            As with many of the groups previously, it's likely there will be a shuffle of people, new groupings and diverging objectives. Some may hang up their tool belts and move on to new things 
            with their lives and others may continue to yearn for the excitement and addictive thrill of the next pwn. I'm sure we'll see further arrests for those splashing cash and not staying dark, 
            and as always some fallout and angry posts from disgruntled members.
        </p>
        <p>
            Time will tell what happens next, but for now it seems, things will be a modicum quieter online...

        <h3>Hackers turns 30</h3>
        <p>
            It can't be - I refuse to believe that so many years have passed under the network bridge... Okay I caught sight of my face in the mirror, yes I can. Hackers was released 30 years ago today in the 'States. 
            It was a month later on the 13th October before those of us on this side of the pond could bask in the glorious cybercopia of this cult classic. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a film that so many of us have gathered around over the years, a pop culture tongue-in-cheek snapshot of the hacking subculture in the early 1990's. Making it's way into our shared lexicon with references 
            littered around in our daily lives, I think it stands as a dividing line of ethos in the industry. It was a very different world back then, with exploration mainly for the fun and knowledge increase. The big shift 
            to financial exploitation happened post-Hackers. Yes, I know, you're going to argue AT&amp;T's timecode change was for financial gain, but it wasn't at the indiscriminant detriment to the people at large that we see today in ransomware. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thirty years of change in the industry has brought new technology, methodologies, landscapes and cultures into play and we of the older generations remember a time when things were simpler, more open and 
            maliable as protocols and systems came into being. We remember the days of pagers and dialups, with time online limited.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hackers remains in my top ten list of favourite films all these years down the line, despite it's hilarious and obvious failings, despite the avant-garde nature of it compared to the people the teams followed in real life, 
            despite the wild shoe-horning of terminology. It's the perfect imperfect film about a cultural group that was adventuring in the early digital realm. A snapshot of psyche from a different age. 
            In a year that also saw The Net released (yes, that's 30 years old this year also - no there's no secret button on my site... or is there...) and Johnny Mnemonic 
            (yes, that's also 30 years old, geez, what, did you give up your childhood memories, oh wait...) we felt as if we were on the crest of something magical. <br/>Then the mega corporations moved in to our neighbourhood... 
        </p>
        <p>
            There is much we've gained since Hackers was released, and much we have lost along the way. In a world where ZeroCool probably now works as CSO at the oil company Plague did; where Cereal Killer runs an Internet radio station (oh, wait..)
            and Burn is CISO for Apple, we all grew up watching the digital world form and evolve around us as we longed for the thrill of the adventure on hardware that is less powerful now than our washing machines and fridges.
        </p>
        <p>
            The birthday of Hackers reminds us that the ideals and goals we shaped the digital world with are still there, just under the dusty layers of piling storage mediums. Find the disk, drop it in the drive and boot up the memories 
            of what got you into all this computing business. There's a world to explore and discover - it's choice man, pure choice. This was our world, the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. -<a href="https://phrack.org/issues/7/3" target="PhrackMag">[Hacker Manifesto]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I miss the days of finding amazing items at computer faires for crazy cheap prices; I miss full tower PC's with SCSI cards and CRT's, 5.75 inch and 3.5 inch disks. I miss Zip disks and Jazz drives, chunky storage for the masses you didn't lose in your bag. I miss the 
            innovation and the eccentric devices available on the market before the time of homogeneous laptops and PC's. Before the corporate shareholders determined profits were more important than innovation and individuality. Perhaps that's why there's such a burgeoning cyberdeck community?
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to remember, in the face of a darker and more hate-filled digital domain, Hackers of the world - unite. We demanded free access to information, well that came at a price but they revoked on the deal. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So this year, on this 30th anniversary of Hackers, I'll be watching it again with a laptop and notebook. I'll be shouting &quot;Hack the Planet!&quot; appropriately all day and remembering fondly a time when BBS boards and Telnet chat sessions 
            were our communications channels. When we dreamed of having too much machine in our hands as we sat in a hacker club with electronic music blaring, coffee flowing and hardware being sold outside. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So Nintendo generation, remember to trust your technolust and rediscover the mindset of adventure, learning and excitement that the years of corporate coalface tore from our memory banks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Happy birthday, Hackers. Here's to the next 30 years together... we're elite.

        <h3>NPM Packages Compromised</h3>
        <p>
            Due to a targeted and fortuitous phishing attack on a developer, twenty popular NPM packages were compromised and infected with malware. Prompting the 
            co-maintainer to enter MFA information, the attackers gained access to the NPM package maintainer's account.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The malware and activity was thankfully caught fairly quickly by the teams and those affected by the incident are relatively limited. The malware-laiden NPM 
            packages have been removed from the system and an analysis of downloads by teams shows a limited issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            NPM packages have a habit of being part of a chain of packages to build larger software, and this type of attack with packages used by millions of users highlights the 
            effectiveness of sidechain attacks. Thankfully, in this instance, these compromised packages were only available between 13:30 and 15:00 UTC on the 8th September before 
            the community cleaned-up the mess in the NPM packages. If your system has pulled packages in this period you are guaranteed to have been infected and are urged to update 
            packages imediately. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The issue with any chained dependancies is that your supplier or their package might have been compromised before you included other software into your development proecess. 
            Generating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a good idea to understand your software and it's dependant items. Utilising an SBOM list, you can run a simple grep for the 
            affected packages to ensure you're not including them within your chain.
        </p>

        <h3>MS BASIC Code Released</h3>
        <p>
            Microsoft have released the sourcecode for the 6502 BASIC it created way back in 1976 which was utilised by many of the early Microcomputer systems we 
            loved and grew up using such as the Commodore PET, Vic-20 and C64. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Written in Assembly language, the code includes fixes to garbage colletion the Commodore identified. Time stamps on the Github repository show commit dates from 48 years ago, with 
            comedic comments on the repository such as &quot;I see the last commit other than the license was 48 years ago. Is this project abandoned?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're playing around with 6502-based 8-bit systems, you now have a range of Assembly to tinker around with to your hearts content and fork the project.
        </p>

        <h3>Salesforce Breach</h3>
        <p>
            The vast list of companies with customer support data compromised in the recent <a href="https://trust.salesloft.com/?uid=Drift%2FSalesforce+Security+Update" target="SalesForceDrift">Salesforce Drift compromise</a> is growing and 
            includes big name brands Google, Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare and Tenable. Cloudflare has provided a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/response-to-salesloft-drift-incident/" target="CloudFlareWin">very comprehensive breakdown</a> of the incident from their 
            discovery through remediation. In a refreshingly transparent post we can see from Cloudflare's investigation a sustained probing of systems by the criminals for around ten days. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Salesloft commented on the 26th August: 
            &quot;Initial findings have shown that the actor’s primary objective was to steal credentials, specifically focusing on sensitive information like AWS access keys, passwords, 
            and Snowflake-related access tokens. We have determined that this incident did not impact customers who do not use our Drift-Salesforce integration. Based on our ongoing investigation, 
            we do not see evidence of ongoing malicious activity related to this incident.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the nature of the information stolen, however, it is more than likely the details will make their way onto the open market or be utilised for phishing or targeted campaigns against 
            customers of the brands. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Drift, the AI chat agent tooling, has been taken offline for now (one does wonder if it will return and how many people will trust it going forward). It's vital that anyone having 
            utilised it in their workflows disconnects, rotates API tokens and runs forensic analysis on their data systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Computers help humanity make terrible decisions incredibly quickly, and AI tooling, it would appear, continues to prove that it makes it more effectively and terribly than a 
            junior developer with no world experience.

        <h3>Fake NPM Package Injects Code</h3>
        <p>
           An NPM package impersonating a legitimate email library has <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodejs-smtp" target="NPM Win">been found</a> by researchers. The package 
           has thankfully now been removed from NPM with a warning.
        </p>
        <p>
            The package, nodejs-smtp, had an identical tagling, page style and README to the legitimate nodemailer package and has been available since April 2025 garnering 347 downloads since 
            it was added to the npm registry.
        </p>
        <p>
            The package uses Electron tooling to unpack Atomic Wallet's app.asar, replacing the vendor bundle with a malicious payload before repackaging the application and removing 
            process traces by deleting the working directory. The primary objective of this is to overwrite the recipient address with hard-coded wallets redirecting 
            Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP and Solana transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still operating as a mailer, it hides the underlying functionality to swipe cryptocurrency in normal operation as an SMTP maailer. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's not the first time we've seen issues with downstream pacakages in this type of attack and it won't be the last.

        <h3>South Korean Telecom Fined for terrible security</h3>
        <p>
           One for the scrapbook of &quot;what in the hell, my good man?&quot;, SK Telecom have mismanaged their network systems security so utterly terribly 
           that the watchdog has fined them $97M for their sloppy practices. The breach, disclosed back in April, led to the unauthorised access to data for almost 27 
           million subscribers. That's over half the population of South Korea (50M). Over HALF the population!
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the regulator's report, SK Telecom failed at every layer of defence and effectively rolled-out the red carpet to their own systems for the 
            cyber criminals that ran amok through their network. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Administrators had left thousands of server credentials in plaintext on a management server; there was no password protection on subscriber databases; IDS logs were not 
            reviewed by teams; 26 Million USIM authentication keys were left unencrypted in the database (leading to the ability to clone SIMS without knowledge); 
            And no response from monitoring teams on the installation of malware and exfiltration of data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The regulator provided a scathing observation &quot;The security operating environment between the internet and the internal network was managed and operated 
            in a state that was very vulnerable to illegal intrusion&quot;. Read that as corporate speak for &quot;step away from the computer, Ralf Wiggum, it's time to go eat crayons&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only slapped with a hefty fine, SK Telecom have now been ordered to implement a range of remedial items including proper encryption, tighter access controls and 
            real-time monitoring of IDS. Just a few things that any Telco should have been implementing by default, you would have imagined.
        </p>

            Telecommunication companies are a high value target that we often only see nation-backed or heavyweight groups going after, but this incident proves the bar for 
            security is not guaranteed to start at certain levels. When you leave your networks wide open with all the goodies on the table, don't be surprised if someone walks 
            off with the food, pooch, car keys, bank cards and chaise longue.

            That's enough Internets for me today.

        <h3>Microsoft Cloud Takeover Ransomware</h3>
        <p>
           Ransomware has been a continual thorn in the side of business for several years now and much of the reported incidents (not everyone does still it seems) 
           are related to systems on corporate network fleets. In a continually &quot;cloud-first&quot; narrative for business, it appears that cybercriminal groups are also chanting 
           the &quot;cloud-first&quot; mantra and evolving their attack patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microsoft's threat intelligence team have caught one of the financially-motivated groups they monitor, Storm-0501, breaking into an enterprise's on-premesis and cloud 
            environments, exfiltrating and destroying resident data before demanding a ransom to get the data back. The attack does not rely on normal malware deployment and saw 
            the enterprise contacted over their own Teams platform to demand the payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attacks seem to pivot from on-premesis systems to the cloud environment through lateral movement and privilege escalation, with the use of Evil-WinRM for remote code 
            execution. DCSync attacked Active Directory and stolen credentials were then used to target cloud-connected systems and ultimately register an Entra ID tenant owned by the 
            criminal group as a trusted federated domain, creating a backdoor to the systems. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The multi-stage processes show a determined and resourceful group with understanding in on-premesis and cloud environments with a new angle on the ransomware process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microsoft have made a change to Entra ID that aims to prevent attackers from abusing the Directory Synchronisation Accounts in attacks to escalate privileges. They also advise 
            using the Trusted Platform Module on Entra Connect Sync Server to store sensitive credentials and cryptographic keys, preventing those from being stolen by attackers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The principles of least-privilege and zero trust should be considered with these hybrid environments, and as always - MFA.
