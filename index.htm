        <h3>ESA Breach</h3>
        <p>
            Space Missions are hard, but it seems that security is harder. In a latest security announcement, the European Space Agency have confirmed they have 
            started criminal investigations after Scattered LapsusS Hunters have claimed to siphon 500GB of data from their systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The agency isn't having a good time of it with security after a hacker known as &quot;888&quot; hoovered 200GB of data over Christmas and this latest 
            breach includes some extremely sensitive information including &quot;operational procedures, spacecraft and mission details, subsystems documentation, 
            and proprietary contractor data from ESA partners including SpaceX, Airbus Group, and Thales Alenia Space&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scientific community has long been known to prioritise data accessibility over security, but the latest breach continues a trend of bad reports of 
            security issues at the agency. As any Intel operative will tell you, any space-related company will be under the microscope from groups to find ways into 
            data, systems, orbital platforms or supply chains. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The breach has claimed to have been possible via an unpatched vulnerability. We'll have to await a full breakdown (if it arrives) to know more.

        <h3>AWS CodeBuild Flaw</h3>
        <p>
            The security company, Wiz, <a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-research-codebreach-vulnerability-aws-codebuild" target="WizWin">discovered a critical flaw in AWS CodeBuild</a> ( dubbed CodeBreach by the team ) 
            that could have potentially led to the complete takeover of AWS's own GitHub repositories and put every AWS account in the world at risk. The team noted it to be potentially worse than the SolarWinds supply chain attack.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discovered back in August 2025, the team contacted AWS who then fixed the security hole in September 2025 before the system could be compromised by groups or agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team details the severity of the issue sternly in their finding report: &quot;The issue allowed a complete takeover of key AWS GitHub repositories - most notably the AWS JavaScript SDK, a core library that powers the AWS Console. By exploiting CodeBreach, attackers could have injected 
            malicious code to launch a platform-wide compromise, potentially affecting not just the countless applications depending on the SDK, but the Console itself, threatening every AWS account.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            In a tale as old as time, a couple of characters in a Regex filter allowed unauthenticated attackers to infiltrate the build environment and leak privileged credentials. Once again, the CI/CD pipeline is in focus as a 
            security pain point. Whilst no action is necessary in this instance to resolve the primary issue, the team are advising a range of security measures to prevent untrusted pull requests triggering privileged builds and securing 
            your GitHub connection with unique fine-grained personal access tokens for each CodeBuild project. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A HUGE thanks need to go to the Wiz team by the world's user populous and a stern question for all our AWS account managers of &quot;why the hell am I hearing about this in global security news months after the event and not from you directly?&quot;.

        <h3>Palo Alto DoS Vulnerability</h3>
        <p>
            Palo Alto <a href="https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2026-0227" target="PaloWin">have announced</a> a CVSS 7.7 vulnerability ( tracked as CVE-2026-0227 ) 
            in the Global Protect PAN-OS software that permits a denial of service attack due to an improper check for exceptional conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The issue affects:
            <ul>
                <li>PAN-OS 12.1 &lt; 12.1.3-h3, &lt; 12.1.4</li>
                <li>PAN-OS 11.2 &lt; 11.2.4-h15, &lt; 11.2.7-h8, &lt; 11.2.10-h2</li>
                <li>PAN-OS 11.1 &lt; 11.1.4-h27, &lt; 11.1.6-h23, &lt; 11.1.10-h9, &lt; 11.1.13</li>
                <li>PAN-OS 10.2 &lt; 10.2.7-h32, &lt; 10.2.10-h30, &lt; 10.2.13-h18, &lt; 10.2.16-h6, &lt; 10.2.18-h1</li>
                <li>PAN-OS 10.1 &lt; 10.1.14-h20</li>
                <li>Prisma Access 11.2 &lt; 11.2.7-h8</li>
                <li>Prisma Access 10.2 &lt; 10.2.10-h29</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Palo Alto confirmed the issue  is applicable only to PAN-OS NGFW or Prisma Access configurations with an enabled GlobalProtect gateway or portal. The exceptional condition 
            allows an unauthenticated attacker to cause a DoS, with repeated attempts resulting in the firewall entering maintenance mode. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst presently the attack does not appear to be actively used in the wild (as yet), it's important to ensure systems are patched as soon as possible.

        <h3>More n8n Woes</h3>
        <p>
            Obviously in the crosshairs of nefarious groups, n8n continues to suffer further woes with a discovery of supply chain attacks on eight 
            packages on npm registry. <a href="https://www.endorlabs.com/learn/n8mare-on-auth-street-supply-chain-attack-targets-n8n-ecosystem" target="EndorWin">Endor Labs have uncovered</a> 
            the first in a new wave of supply chain attacks on n8n and its community node ecosystem. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Behaving like any other n8n integration once it is installed, it displays the usual configuration screens and saves the Google account OAuth tokens 
            in encrypted format to the n8n credential store. When the workflow is executed, however, it runs code to decrypt the stored tokens using n8n's master 
            key and then exfiltrates the credentials to a remote server.
        </p>
        <p>
            The list of currently malicious packages is as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>n8n-nodes-hfgjf-irtuinvcm-lasdqewriit (4,241 downloads, author: kakashi-hatake)</li>
                <li>n8n-nodes-ggdv-hdfvcnnje-uyrokvbkl (1,657 downloads, author: kakashi-hatake)</li>
                <li>n8n-nodes-vbmkajdsa-uehfitvv-ueqjhhhksdlkkmz (1,493 downloads, author: kakashi-hatake)</li>
                <li>n8n-nodes-performance-metrics (752 downloads, author: hezi109)</li>
                <li>n8n-nodes-gasdhgfuy-rejerw-ytjsadx (8,385 downloads, author: zabuza-momochi)</li>
                <li>n8n-nodes-danev (5,525 downloads, author: dan_even_segler)</li>
                <li>n8n-nodes-rooyai-model (1,731 downloads, author: haggags)</li>
                <li>n8n-nodes-zalo-vietts (4,241 downloads, authors: vietts_code and diendh)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Previous warnings on community node security risks have been issues by n8n and on self-hosted n8n instances it is strongly advised to disable community nodes 
            by setting <strong>N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED</strong> to false.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is likely automation systems such as n8n along with CI/CD tooling will increasingly come under attack as workloads on them integrate with so many different 
            platforms and hold high permission credentials. It is a reminder that security boundaries are not just around running platforms, but encircle the whole developer 
            and operational environment.

        <h3>Another n8n Vulnerability</h3>
        <p>
            Oh it's a heavy time for n8n at the start of 2026 and today brings a CVSS score of 10.0 for the already terrified - this one aptly named &quot;Ni8mare&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            Published in an <a href="https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security/advisories/GHSA-v4pr-fm98-w9pg" target="n8nWin">advisory by n8n</a>, the team warns 
            &quot;A vulnerability in n8n allows an attacker to access files on the underlying server through execution of certain form-based workflows. A vulnerable 
            workflow could grant access to an unauthenticated remote attacker. This could result in exposure of sensitive information stored on the system and may 
            enable further compromise depending on deployment configuration and workflow usage.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            There are no official workarounds for the vulnerability, which affects all versions up to the fix in 1.121.0
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem appears to be linked to the webhook and file handling mechanism and allows threat actors to leverage the security hole and read arbitrary files from the 
            n8n instance and escalate further to RCE. Compromise of n8n doesn't just stop with the system itself, but yeilds credentials for other systems, stored data and tokens.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're running n8n, keep on patching.

        <h3>New n8n CVE</h3>
        <p>
            A new year, a new vulnerability in software the world is using merrily. The latest vulnerability in n8n comes hot on the heels of the 
            <a href="https://www.thecloudhacker.co.uk/news/2025/20251223-n8nVulnerability.htm">previous CVE in December</a> which also allowed attackers 
            to execute commands.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new vulnerability ( <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68668" target="n8ncveWin">CVE-2025-68668</a> ) is classified as a Protection 
            Mechanism Failure, rated at 9.9 on the &quot;oh crud!&quot; meter. Affecting versions 1.0.0 through to 2.0.0, any authenticated user with permission to 
            create or modify workflows to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the host running n8n
        </p>
        <p>
            n8n have confirmed they implemented a &quot;task runner-based native Python implementation in version 1.111.0 as an optional feaature for improved security isolation&quot;. 
            The feature can be enabled using the N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED and N8N_NATIVE_PYTHON_RUNNER environment variables prior to 2.0.0 where it is enabled by default.
        </p>
        <p>
            As workarounds, n8n is recommending that users:
            <ol>
                <li>Disable the Code Node by setting the environment variable <strong>NODES_EXCLUDE:</strong> &quot;[\&quot;n8n-nodes-base.code\&quot;]&quot;</li>
                <li>Disable Python support in the Code node by setting the environment variable <strong>N8N_PYTHON_ENABLED=false</strong></li>
                <li>Configure n8n to use the task runner-based Python sandbox via the <strong>N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED</strong> and <strong>N8N_NATIVE_PYTHON_RUNNER</strong> environment variables</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            As adoption of powerful and easy-to-use tooling becomes more normal, it's likely to find itself a target for higher scrutiny by nefarious parties.

        <h3>Kimwolf Botnet</h3>
        <p>
            Brian Krebs has <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/" target="krebsWin">documented a new botnet</a> discovered by 
            Benjamin Brundage, the 22-year-old founder of the security firm Synthient, which has been 
            dubbed <strong>Kimwolf</strong>. It has so far infected an estimated 2 Million devices globally, utilising flaws in residential proxy services.
        </p>
        <p>
            The malware that seems to be targetting unofficial Android-based TV boxes and photo frames turns a user's Internet connection into a proxy node, allowing attackers 
            to squirrel around on your LAN or use your Internet connection for botnet activities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Synthinet has <a href="https://synthient.com/check" target="kimwolfCheckWin">generated a page on their website</a> to help users verify if their public IP has been tracked as a member of the Kimwolf botnet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Brundage has also compiled <a href="https://github.com/synthient/public-research/blob/main/2026/01/kimwolf/product_devices.csv" target="synthinetWin">a list of the unofficial Android boxes</a> most highly represented in the botnet.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you find or own a box matching one of the model names and/or numbers in the list, pull it out of your network and consider yeeting it into the fires of the scrap recycling centre.

        <h3>MongoDB Bleeds Memory Data</h3>
        <p>
            A flaw in Zlib compression protocol header length ( <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14847" target="CVEWin">CVE-2025-14847</a> ) which is utilised by default 
            in MongoDB can return uninitialized heap memory without authenticating to the server. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Tracked by MongoDB and thankfully with a patch available ( <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-115508" target="MongoWin">MongoDB Jira Ticket</a>), the MongoDB team urge 
            users to patch immediately even though there are no <em>current reports</em> of active exploitation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This data leak vulnerability affects the following versions:
            <ul>
                <li>MongoDB 8.2.0 through 8.2.3</li>
                <li>MongoDB 8.0.0 through 8.0.16</li>
                <li>MongoDB 7.0.0 through 7.0.26</li>
                <li>MongoDB 6.0.0 through 6.0.26</li>
                <li>MongoDB 5.0.0 through 5.0.31</li>
                <li>MongoDB 4.4.0 through 4.4.29</li>
                <li>All MongoDB Server v4.2 versions</li>
                <li>All MongoDB Server v4.0 versions</li>
                <li>All MongoDB Server v3.6 versions</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The team have also advised &quot;If you cannot upgrade immediately, disable zlib compression on the MongoDB Server by 
            starting mongod or mongos with a networkMessageCompressors or a net.compression.compressors option that explicitly omits 
            zlib. Example safe values include snappy,zstd or disabled&quot;

        <h3>Cisco AsyncOS Zero Day</h3>
        <p>
            'Twas the week before Christmas and all through the NOC, Cisco Admins were screaming and Criminals running amok.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco have <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sma-attack-N9bf4">announced a critical vulnerability</a> in the AsyncOS software under active exploitation by Chinese APT's. The attack campaign 
            affects Cisco Secure Email Gateway systems (physical AND virtual) and Cisco Secure Web Manager appliances (physical AND virtual) of <strong>ALL release versions</strong> 
            when these conditions are met:
            <ul>
                <li>The appliance is configured with the Spam Quarantine feature</li>
                <li>The Spam Quarantine feature is exposed to and reachable from the Internet</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco have uncovered exploitation dating back to at least late November 2025 with the vulnerability being used to drop tunneling tools like ReverseSSH and Chisel. A lightweight Python backdoor has been also seen 
            capable of receiving encoded commands and executing them. The CVE ( CVE-2025-20393 ) has a rating score of 10.0 and in the absence of a patch, 
            administrators are being urged to restore their appliances to a secure configuration; limit access from the Internet; secure devices behind a firewall and only allow traffic from trusted hosts; 
            separate mail and management functionality onto a separate network interface; monitor web log traffic for unexpected traffic and disable HTTP for the main administration portal.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, Season's greetings, admin teams - I hope you didn't have any plans for this weekend.

        <h3>New AWS Crypto Miner attack</h3>
        <p>
            It's been a thorn in the side for AWS-based companies for at least ten years now, and it's taken an interesting new turn. The deployment of 
            crypto mining infrastructure from exposed or stolen keys has been a vast financial sink hole for countless companies, but 
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/cryptomining-campaign-targeting-amazon-ec2-and-amazon-ecs/" target="AWSwin" >Amazon have uncovered </a>
            a new variant which has a sneaky attack mode targeting EC2 and ECS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a key has been swiped by the criminal, resources and permissions are quickly enumerated before deploying the crypto mining resources across EC2 and ECS. 
            The multi-stage attack begins with a discovery phase, running probes with the stolen IAM credentials to test permissions by using the --DryRun flag. This enables 
            the attacker to validate IAM permissions without launching infrastructure, avoiding cost increase triggers and minimising forensic evidence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The process continues with a CreateServiceLinkedRole and CreateRole phase to generate IAM roles for autoscaling groups and AWS Lambda, then attaching the 
            AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole policy. The ECS clusters deployed then register a malicious DockerHub image ( yenik65958/secret:user ) , creating a service using the 
            task definition to initiate crypto mining on ECS Fargate nodes. The DockerHub image has been thankfully taken down ( after over 100,000 pulls ), however the data 
            shows it configured to initiate a shell script on launch to start cryptocurrency mining using the RandomVIREL mining algorithm. The threat actor has also been observed 
            to exploit EC2 service quotas to maximise resource consumption with scaling between 20 and 999 instances, targeting both high-performance GPU and machine learning 
            instances as well as compute, memory and GP instances.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attack also stands out for it's use of the ModifyInstanceAttribute action to enable termination protection, preventing instances from being terminated using the 
            EC2 console, CLI or API. This action makes response to the incident more involved and shows an understanding of the standard clean-up practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amazon reccomends GuardDuty is in place and enabled on all accounts and regions with Runtime monitoring enabled, along with integration to the Security Hub. As always, 
            strong IAM controls are critically important with temporary keys instead of long-term access keys and enforced MFA on all accounts. Least privilege permissions should be 
            the default as always and ship those logs to review easily as necessary by your teams!

        <h3>React2Shell Attacks Accelerate</h3>
        <p>
            The React2Shell server-side vulnerability ( CVE-2025-55182 ) that dropped this month is quickly becoming a growing issue for sites across the Internet. With the 
            React Server Components and dependent frameworks ( such as Next.js ) being so utilised across websites, this vulnerability is a huge concern. The unsafe 
            deserialisation allows unauthenticated attackers to send crafted requests to achieve remote code execution. A single exposed endpoint can provide an entry point to 
            larger estates, particularly worrying for multi-hosting servers. 
        </p>

        <h3>Another Chrome &quot;Patch Now&quot; Drop</h3>
        <p>
            Google have pushed security updates for the Chrome browser to fix <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/12/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_10.html" target="ChromeWin">three security flaws</a> with one being found under active exploitation. The team 
            are keeping the details under close guard until enough of the userbase has upgraded to the latest patched versions.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The update <strong>143.0.7499.109/.110</strong> on Windows or Mac and <strong>143.0.7499.109</strong> on Linux are the current patched versions. It's important to ensure you run the update as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            This update takes the quantity of zero-day flaws to eight this year. Thankfully the security teams are actively engaged in seeking and resolving issues before they reach the stable channel. The latest updates continue 
            to prove that continuous patching cycles are necessary to maintain a strong security posture.

        <h3>Cloudflare Mitigates Largest Ever (so far) DDoS</h3>
        <p>
            Cloudflare have announced they detected and mitigated the largest ever (so far) DDoS measuring 29.7 terabits per second. Originating from a DDoS 
            botnet-for-hire known as AISURU, the attack lasted for 69 seconds. Cloudflare did not disclose the target of this attack.
        </p>
        <p>
            The AISURU botnet has prominently targeted telecoms providers, hosting providers, gaming companies and financial services. The attack was 
            UDP bombarding an average of 15,000 destination ports per second, randomising various packet attributes in an attempt to evade detection and defences.
        </p>
        <p>
            The growing DDoS problem has been seen hand-in-hand with the increase in malware, targeting and infecting as many devices as possible to utilise in these attacks. The usual kudos for 
            having the largest botnet army is high on the agenda - more bots equals more likelyhood of causing issues for targets, equals higher price for hire.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite mitigating the incident in this battle, the war is yet to be over and we are likely to see an increased quantity of these high figure attacks in 2026.

        <h3>NPM Woes Continue</h3>
        <p>
            I'd like to say this was just the Annus Horribilis for Node Package Manager, but I fear this is just the shape of things to come for the forseeable future. In today's 
            ongoing saga of issues, North Korean threat actors behind the Contagious Interview campaign spammed the npm registry with 197 more malicious packages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team at <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/north-korea-contagious-interview-npm-attacks" target="SocketWin">Socket</a> have been tracking the progress of the 
            npm attacks which are designed to deliver a variant of OtterCookie. Once launched, the software attempts to evade any sandboxes and virtual machines, profiles the machine 
            and establishes a command and control channel to provide the attackers with a remote shell, along with the ability to steal clipboard contents, log keystrokes, capture 
            screenshots, gather browser credentials, documents, cryptocurrency wallet data and seed phrases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The utilisation of these types of package attacks are likely to cause significant damage as they are being coupled with fake interview processes, a recent tactic to get 
            developers to install and run code on their systems in the hope of completing technical assessment to secure a new role. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's that time of year whereby people consider where they're heading in their career and starting to look elsewhere - just the ideal time for the threat actors to 
            pretend to be a recruitment agency and have developers install malware. If that's undertaken on workplace machines, it might cause significant compromise or data theft 
            at a time when teams are trying to wind-down for the holidays.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll have to see what further npm headlines appear in the first few months of 2026.

        <h3>JSONformatter and CodeBeautify Data Leaks</h3>
        <p>
            You would have thought in the current climate of security consciousness that users would have enough savvy to not just blindly paste information into 
            websites online that reformat and provide that information back on an open-access link, but you'd be wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the continuing case of &quot;finding new ways to exfiltrate data by oblivious stupidity&quot;, years of corporate data has been found to have leaked (and remains) 
            on the online tool sites JSONformatter and CodeBeautify. Cybersecurity company watchTowr Labs <a href="https://labs.watchtowr.com/stop-putting-your-passwords-into-random-website" target="watchTowrWin">captured a dataset</a> of over 80,000 files which contained: usernames and passwords; 
            repository authentication keys; Active Directory, Database and FTP credentials; Cloud keys; LDAP configuration inforamtion; helpdesk API keys; meeting room API keys; SSH session 
            recordings and all manner of personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, just a few items of interest, then.
        </p>
        <p>
            One might consider that the data might be limited to developers running some early-doors testing, however the companies affected span critical national infrastructure, 
            government, finance, insurance, banking, technology, retail, aerospace, telecommunications, healthcare, education, travel and cybersecurity sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, let's just say, the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            In modern news there is so much emphasis placed on elite hackers breaking through tiny cracks in firewalls or security systems, whilst it appears a simple script scanning across online tooling 
            can provide more readily availale data. This isn't so much a back door as a thousand acre farm with an &quot;Open All Hours&quot; neon sign at the open entrance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Excuse me, I'm off to rotate all my corporate and personal data in case someone thought it was useful to paste bin my life...

        <h3>U.S. Worker guilty of sabotage on ex-employer</h3>
        <p>
            A U.S. worker in Ohio has pleaded guilty of sabotaging his ex-employer's computer systems causing $862,000 worth of damage. The 35-year old contractor, 
            Maxwell Shultz, impersonated another contractor to operate powershell scripts and attempt to cover his tracks by removing logs after being 
            fired from the unnamed company.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scripts reset the passwords to around 2,500 accounts on the system and caused the stated damage cost in downtime, disruption to customer services and 
            remediation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Maxwell will be sentenced at the end of January, facing up to ten years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet another case of disgruntled employees with too much access to systems highlights the need to have sanitation routines on passwords, keys and systems when 
            offboarding employees with wide-ranging access.

        <h3>Claude AI used for cyber espionage</h3>
        <p>
           In a <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf">security report from Anthropic</a>  the first catalogued usage of AI tools 
           to attempt access to over thirty high-profile companies and government organisations. In some cases, the attacks was successful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traced-back to a Chinese state-sponsored group, the attackers used Claude Code and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to run the attacks without a human in the tactical execution loop. 
            A human-developed framework utilised Claude to orchestrate multi-stage attacks, which were then in-turn carried out by several Claude sub-agents, all performing specific tasks. 
            Once the sub-agents had developed exploit chains and their associated custom payloads, human operators spent between two and ten minutes reviewing the results of the AI's actions, then signing-off on the subsequent exploitations.
            The sub-agents ran to find and validate credentials, escalate privileges, moving laterally across the network, accessing and then stealing sensitive data. Post-exploitation, the human operator only had to again review the AI's 
            work before approving the final data exfiltration.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;While we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale&quot; states Anthropic's new analysis. As with standard AI, it &quot;requently overstated findings and occasionally 
            fabricated data during autonomous operations&quot;. So, it's not just normal development teams suffering from the cocky and erroneous &quot;I'm amazing!&quot; responses from AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            It may be the first documented case, but with the rise of automated systems it is unlikely to be the solitary example in the news.
