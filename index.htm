    <h1>The Cloud Hacker</h1>
        <p>
            Last of the Gen-X series to roll-off the production line and born in the heart of Teesside. 
            The Cloud Hacker can be found behind a computer screen, behind a musical instrument or in front of an audience.

    <h2>Who?</h2>
        <p>
            I've worked in a range of areas over the years ( check out my   <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rick-trotter/29/5a1/766" target="linkwin">LinkedIn profile</a> ) 
            with a number of very successful projects to my name, but I'm still learning daily!
        </p>
    <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a sucker for anything Victorian, especially anything scientific or engineering-focused from that era. 
            I play a variety of instruments including the cigar box guitar, I'm building a cottage garden in my spare time and growing my own vegetables.
        </p>
        <p>
            I sometimes do speaking events and even write the odd book. If you'd like me to do that sort of thing for you, contact me! 
        </p>
    <h2>Where?</h2>
        <p>
            Currently living in the Northeast of England and working on a nation's critical national infrastructure through a UK consultancy firm.
