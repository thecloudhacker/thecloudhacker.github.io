        <h2>General Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Last of the Gen-X series to roll-off the production line and born in the heart of Teesside. A husband and father who has grown up 
            in the shadow of the threat of nuclear war, and through the birth of the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having worked in a range of areas over the years ( check out my   <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rick-trotter/29/5a1/766" target="linkwin" class="orangelink">{ LinkedIn profile }</a> ) 
            with a number of very successful projects to my name, I'm still learning daily.
        </p>
        <p>
            My early days of learning were on Microcomputers ( Z80 and 6502 ) with teenage years spent on 68000 and 8086 programming. Since the early 2000's I've been working 
            in systems administration before moving into cloud infrastructure and SRE work. 
        </p>
        <h2>Vices and Virtues</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a sucker for anything Victorian, especially anything scientific or engineering-focused from that era. If it's steam-powered I'm usually grinning from ear-to-ear and asking 
            questions of the operators. If it's got an electronic circuit I'm often looking at the technical drawings. If it's space-related I'm making notes and seeing if there's fun 
            to be had trying to communicate with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I play a variety of instruments. I used to play in a lot of bands in the 1990's and 2000's but nowadays I just jam with 
            my son or ocassionally friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm building a cottage garden in my spare time and growing my own fruit and vegetables to make sure I don't spend too much time behind a screen.

        <h2>Reclusive Geek</h2>
        <p>
            I live and thrive in the Northeast of England, working remotely from my self-built Northern Operations Center for a UK Satellite Thermal Imaging Company.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been online since the early days of the Internet, lurking in the Ethernet, making friends across the planet. These days, in my older years, I'm more reclusive.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can be mainly found behind a computer terminal, or sometimes speaking in front of an audience if it means helping people out at events such as 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbZq9b5PxOc" target="_youwin" class="orangelink">{ BSides Newcastle }</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From my Northern Operations Center I support and empower teams internationally, enabling them to do the incredible. 
        </p>

        <h2>Why this pseudonym?</h2>
        <p>
            Life changes, roles change, people change. Change is good and necessary to survive. For many years I was the gingerCoder, 
            working in a world of developers, writing software and solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In recent years I've been working in SRE / Operations / Cloud architect roles, maintaining systems; hacking 
            dead stacks back into order and being a digital janitor for companies. I work in cloud infrastructure so it made sense for a time of change.
        </p>
        <p>
            I retired my gingerCoder side ( for the most part ) and emerged again, acknowledging that I'm not the man I used to be ( thank goodness* ) 
            although I am a sum of my decades of experience and learning.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>Tech History</h2>
        <p>
            Starting in the world of network administration, <span class="orangelink">TheCloudHacker</span> began life in the Windows NT4 Terminal Services days and 
            followed roles and work to keep food on the table. Sometimes that included teaching in schools, sometimes it meant developing web applications. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Migrating from building server rooms with physical tin, through to virtualisation on XenServer and VMWare, 
            the world moved to &quot;Someone else's computer&quot; in the Cloud and he was caught in the wake of a changing landscape. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Picking up the DevOps ethos early-on, he moved into SRE roles working in partnership with development teams and continued learning IaC as it became a popular 
            and useful entity.<br/>
            He began running sessions and training for DevOps, aiding new staff in their journey into the world of I.T.<br/>
            <span class="orangelink">TheCloudHacker</span> has looked after critical national infrastructure for a nation state as well as communicating with 
            custom hardware spacecraft.<br/>
            He continues to learn new methods daily while training the next generation of operations staff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today he works in the Space industry for a satellite imagery company trying to help the world understand the impact we're having on our environment.
