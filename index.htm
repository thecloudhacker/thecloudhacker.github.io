        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            Last of the Gen-X series to roll-off the production line and born in the heart of Teesside. A ginger husband and geek father who has grown up 
            in the shadow of the threat of nuclear war and the birth of the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've worked in a range of areas over the years ( check out my   <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rick-trotter/29/5a1/766" target="linkwin" class="orangelink">{ LinkedIn profile }</a> ) 
            with a number of very successful projects to my name, but I'm still learning daily!
        </p>
        <p>
            My early days of learning were on Microcomputers ( Z80 and 6502 ) with teenage years spent on 68000 and 8086 programming. Since the early 2000's I've been working 
            in systems administration before moving into cloud infrastructure and SRE work.

        <h2>What do I do?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a sucker for anything Victorian, especially anything scientific or engineering-focused from that era. If it's steam-powered I'm usually grinning from ear-to-ear and asking 
            questions of the operators. If it's got an electronic circuit I'm often looking at the technical drawings. <br/>
            I play a variety of instruments including the cigar box guitar. I'm building a cottage garden in my spare time and growing my own fruit and vegetables.
        </p>
        <p>
            I sometimes do speaking events and even write the odd book. If you'd like me to do that sort of thing for you, contact me!

        <h2>Where do I do it?</h2>
        <p>
            Currently living in the Northeast of England and working on a nation's critical national infrastructure through a UK consultancy firm.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been online since the early days of the Internet, lurking in the ethernet and making friends across the planet.

            The Cloud Hacker can be found behind a computer screen, behind a musical instrument or in front of an audience.
