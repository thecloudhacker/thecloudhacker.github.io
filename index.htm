        <h3>Qantas airlines suffers Data Breach</h3>
        <p class="dateField">3rd July 2025</p>
        <p>
            The Australian airline, Qantas has notified the Australian Federal Police of a serious data breach in one of it's contact centres. 
            Used for customer services, the system holds data on six million people including the name, address, contact number, birth date and frequent flyer numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thankfully the system does not hold financial or passport information and is related to the third-party support centre. Qantas is still investigating 
            the extent of the breach along with authorities, on the back of similar incidents taking place with Hawaiian Airlines and Canada's WestJet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attacks are believed to be from the cyber criminal group, Scattered Spider, who often lean heavily on social engineering to convince staff to 
            register rogue multifactor authentication devices. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The FBI recently formally warned the airline industry of the threat of targetted attacks on their services and the Australian Privacy Commissioner, Carly Kind, 
            urged businesses and government agencies to step up security measures and data protection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attack continues to highlight the need for staff training and processes in place to protect against social engineering and side-chain attacks aimed at 
            negating the main security layers.

        <h3>No Digital Ceasefire in World Conflicts</h3>
        <p>
            In the wake of the tensions between Israel and Iran, the former NATO hacker, Candan Bolukbas ( CTO and founder of Black Kite ) has warned 
            &quot;In the cyber world, there's no such thing as a ceasefire&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bolukbas has raised concerns of Iran continuing to target supply chains of Israel and the U.S. DoD suppliers to find an exploitable vector in 
            retaliation to the events in the Middle East.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;My belief is that they're going to go after the supply chain, because that's our weak spot&quot; Bolukbas said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst countries may have a physical ceasefire in operation, the digital realm continues to see ongoing hostility between nations as each tries to 
            find leverage in the event of escalation.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;The US has the biggest cyber army, strategic or talent-wise, the NSA is known for having the biggest zero-day arsenal on the planet. We have a doctrine 
            on something called defense forward that says if we see something in cyberspace that can disrupt us, we're going to attack it first, and we have that under US Cyber Command's mission.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The advise to those outside the milirary trying to hold our networks and systems together? 
            <ul>
            <li>&quot;Be careful with phishing attacks, that's very common because Iran doesn't have a lot of zero days, so they go heavy on social attacks. Be careful what you're clicking on.&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;Patch your systems, including IoT for end users and residential people,&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;Patch your external-facing systems quickly, not a week or 10 days or a month later, because time is ticking from the day that the vulnerability is disclosed. Iranian groups are trying to develop an exploit.&quot;</li>
            </ul>
            &quot;If they develop the exploit before the patch, they're not going to hesitate to use that.&quot;
        </p>

        <h3>Glasgow City Council Suffers Cyber Attack</h3>
        <p>
            On Thursday 19th June, Glasgow City Council's ICT supplier (CGI) discovered malicious activity on servers managed by a third-party supplier.  This may or may not include the theft 
            of customer data in the process. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The resulting tear-down of the affected servers for investigation has caused widespread service access issues, leading to the loss of a range of day-to-day online processes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The notification from the Council states &quot;We are conducting an investigation into the incident, alongside Police Scotland, the Scottish Cyber Coordination Centre (SC3) and the National Cyber Security Centre.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;At this stage we can't confirm whether data has actually been removed and, if so, what that data is. As a precaution, we are operating on the presumption that customer data related to the currently unavailable web forms may have been exfiltrated, 
            and we have contacted the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on this basis. No council financial systems have been affected in this attack and no details of bank accounts or credit/debit cards processed by those systems have been compromised. &quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The council services across the United Kingdom have encountered a slew of cyber attacks in recent years, with the most vulnerable in the local community the most affected.
        </p>
        <p>
            The incident again highlights the increasing popularity of side-chain attacks and the lack of security around council-run services.
        </p>
