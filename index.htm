        <h3>Europol Shuts Down Cybercrime Forum</h3>
        <p>
            On the 22nd July as a part of a series of coordinated enforcement actions, the French Police and Paris Prosecutor in close cooperation with their 
            Ukrainian counterpart and Europol arrested the suspected administrator of xss.is, one of the world's most influential Russian-speaking cybercrime platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            With more than 50,000 registered users, it served as a key marketplace for stolen data, hacking tools and illicit services while being a central platform for 
            some of the most active and dangerous cybercriminal networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The arrest in Kyiv, Ukraine, happened after a long investigation dating back to 2021, which was initiated by the French Police. Europol provided essential operational and 
            analytical support throughout the investigation, facilitating coordination and information exchange between the French Police and Ukrainian authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Europol assisted in mapping the cybercriminal infrastructure, linking the suspect to other major threat actors. They deployed a mobile office to support French and 
            Ukrainian teams with on-site coordination and evidence collection. The seized data will be analysed to support ongoing investigations across Europe and beyond it's borders.
        </p>
        <p>
            The administrator of the forum was known to have a central role in enabling criminal activity alongside acting as the technical operator of the site. He is also believed to have 
            run thesecure.biz private messaging service tailored to the needs of the cybercriminal underground. It's estimated that he made around seven million euros in profit from advertising 
            and facilitation fees.

        <h3>Sharepoint Actively Exploited</h3>
        <p>
            The recently disclosed vulnerabilities for Sharepoint on-premises (CVE-2025-53770, CVE-2025-49705, CVE-2025-53771 and CVE-2025-49706) are now 
            being actively exploited by at least three Chinese groups according to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/" target="MSsecurity">reports from Microsoft's threat team</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microsoft has observed the nation-state groups Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon exploiting the vulnerabilities, targeting Internet-facing Sharepoint servers. The groups are known for 
            specifically focusing on data theft. A third actor is not as-yet known to be state-sponsored, classified as &quot;Storm-2603&quot; is continuing to be monitored. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Administrators are being warned if they have on-premises Sharepoint that has not yet been patched, it is likely the systems have been compromised. 
        </p>
        <p>
            SharePoint Server variants &quot;Subscription Edition&quot;, &quot;2019&quot;, and &quot;2016&quot; all have fixes available to download. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;In observed attacks, threat actors send a crafted POST request to the SharePoint server, uploading a malicious script named spinstall0.aspx. 
            Actors have also modified the file name in a variety of ways, such as spinstall.aspx, spinstall1.aspx, spinstall2.aspx, etc. The spinstall0.aspx 
            script contains commands to retrieve MachineKey data and return the results to the user through a GET request, enabling the theft of the key material by threat actors.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            With the disclosure and active exploits, it's likely smaller or individual groups will begin to utilise the attack vector to gain access to unpatched Sharepoint systems.

        <h3>Cisco ISE Vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>
            Cisco has issued a patch for the Identity Services Engine (ISE) and ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) that allowed unauthenticated 
            remote attackers the ability to run arbitrary code on the operating system with root privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
            CVE-2025-20337 is a 10/10 horror-fest related to CVE-2025-20281, disclosed in June and also receiving a 10/10 CVSS rating.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are no workarounds but thankfully Cisco released a software update that fixes the flaws, along with CVE-2025-20282. According to Cisco there 
            are no known exploits (yet) for any of the vulnerabilities. However, with disclosure comes a slew of &quot;research&quot; by people on both sides of the 
            ethical divide. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco's <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-unauth-rce-ZAd2GnJ6" target="ciscoWebsite">security advisory website</a> provides 
            details on affected systems and includes:
            <ul>
                <li>CVE-2025-20281 and CVE-2025-20337: These vulnerabilities affect Cisco ISE and ISE-PIC releases 3.3 and 3.4, regardless of device configuration. These vulnerabilities do not affect Cisco ISE and ISE-PIC Release 3.2 or earlier.</li>
                <li>CVE-2025-20282: This vulnerability affects only Cisco ISE and ISE-PIC Release 3.4, regardless of device configuration. This vulnerability does not affect Cisco ISE and ISE-PIC Release 3.3 or earlier.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the nature of the vulnerability, it's critical to run patching as soon as possible now the disclosure is freely available.

        <h3>Ukrainian Hackers destroy Russian Drone Maker's Network</h3>
        <p>
            According to reports on Telegram channels, the Russian Gaskar Integration plane, one of the largest suppliers of drones for the Army 
            has been taken-out by Ukranian hackers alongside the military intelligence agency, Black Owl.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Telegram post states they &quot;carried out large-scale work to capture the entire network and server infrastructure of Gaskar Group, 
            collect valuable information about the UAVs being produced and prospective, and then destroy the information and disable this infrastructure&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the statement around 47TB of technical information about the production of Russian drones was destroyed including 10TB of backup files. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Ukrainian Cyber Alliance said they also stole all of the source code before destroying everything and further reported: <br/>
            &quot; from the information we received, China is providing assistance in the production and training of specialists of Gaskar Group&quot;<br/>
            &quot;The network went down so thoroughly that the doors in the building were blocked&quot;

        <h3>NVIDIA Docker Escape</h3>
        <p>
            In a week of events we close-out with the horrifying disclosure that 37% of cloud environments are vulnerable to a flaw 
            in NVIDIA's Container Toolkit that provides attackers with root access to the host machine. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With three simple lines of code <a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/nvidia-ai-vulnerability-cve-2025-23266-nvidiascape" target="WizWin">detailed in the Wiz disclosure article</a> 
            it's possible to escape container workloads and rampage through the parent host, potentially further meddling in environments being used by other companies 
            and customers on the cloud infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The CVE, CVE-2025-23266, has been assigned a CVSS score of 9.0 (critical) and bypasses isolation measures by exploiting a subtle misconfiguration in how the toolkit 
            handles OCI hooks. Anyone with NVIDIA Continer Toolkit up to and including v1.17.7 (CDI mode only for versions prior to 1.17.5) and/or NVIDIA GPU Operator up to and including 25.3.1 is 
            vulnerable to the attack.
        </p>
        <p>
            Containers have been hailed as isolated environments that keep workloads safe, but as this continues to highlight, they are not a strong security barrier and should not be 
            relied on as the only method of workload isolation. If you are not considering a possibility of exit from your container, you could be exposing your other customers or 
            data stores to threat actors.
        </p>
        <p>
            With many hosted AI systems utilising NVIDIA Toolkits, the possibility that the system you're renting or sharing infrastructure on is compromised could be higher than you expect.

        <h3>Europol Operation Eastwood</h3>
        <p>
            Europol and Eurojust have completed an operation this week, named &quot;Eastwood&quot;, targeting the cybercrime network &quot;NoName057(16)&quot;. The pro-Russian cybercrime network 
            were responsible for attacks primarily focused on Ukraine, however shifted focus towards countries supporting Ukraine. Action by the group has been tracked against several European countries 
            in 2023 and 2024, mainly focused around Denial of Service attacks to public institutions and strategic sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nineteen countries were involved in the operation with two hundred police officers assigned. In total, twenty four houses were searched with two arrests and seven warrants issued. Thirteen individuals 
            have been questioned, with over one thousand supporters notified of legal liability and over one hundred servers disrupted worldwide. The major part of NoName057(16) infrastructure was taken offline in the process. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, as with the Scattered Spider arrests this last week, younger offenders were targeted by the cybercrime network. Europol explains on their operation site: 
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;To share calls to action, tutorials, updates, and to recruit volunteers, the group leveraged pro-Russian channels, forums, and even niche chat groups on social media and messaging apps. Volunteers often invited friends or contacts from gaming or hacking forums, forming small recruitment circles. These actors used platforms like DDoSia to simplify technical processes and provide guidelines, enabling new recruits to become operational quickly.<br/>
            Participants were also paid in cryptocurrency, which incentivised sustained involvement and attracted opportunists. Mimicking game-like dynamics, regular shout-outs, leader boards, or badges provided volunteers with a sense of status. This gamified manipulation, often targeted at younger offenders, was emotionally reinforced by a narrative of defending Russia or avenging political events.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the suspects are internationally listed as wanted, and in some have their identities published in the media. Five of the profiles were also published on the EU Most Wanted website. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Full details of the operation and outcomes can be found on <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/global-operation-targets-noname05716-pro-russian-cybercrime-network" target="EuropolSite">Europol's Site.</a>

        <h3>Sonicwall SMA 100 Series Vulnerability</h3>
        <p>
            The Sonicwall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series (now end-of-line) provided secure remote access solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. Designed as 
            an easy-to-deploy system for those businesses that need access and security without having to have heavy technical staffing, it's likely to be dwelling in small and medium 
            business network racks in back offices across the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the fully-patched nature of the end-of-life SMA 100, a threat activity cluster (UNC6148) has been observed by 
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/sonicwall-secure-mobile-access-exploitation-overstep-backdoor" target="GoogleSecurity" >Google's Threat Intelligence Group </a> 
            targeting the devices in order to drop a backdoor called &quot;OVERSTEP&quot;. The attack seems to date back at least to October 2024, potentially due to related to CVE's from late 2023 and 2024,  
            and analysis suggests that UNC6148 may have exfiltrated credentials from the SMA appliance as early as January 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
            The backdoor appears to generate a SSL VPN session spawning a reverse shell. The overall intent appears to be to facilitate data theft and extortion operations with the potential for 
            ransomware deployment on the network inside the SMA.
        </p>
        <p>
            The nature of the compromise to the equipment requires the verification of the disk image deployed with particular attention to file system artifacts along with log and network analysis and 
            lateral movement over SSH from the SMA to other systems in your environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Organisations are advised to isolate compromised equipment, preservation of disk images and telemetry for forensics and then deployment of new images with reset credentials, OTP bindings for all local and 
            directory users on the appliance and the revoking and reissue of any certificates with private keys stored on the original appliance.

        <h3>U.K. NCA Arrests four for retailer attacks</h3>
        <p>
            On the 10th July, the U.K. National Crime Agency arrested four individuals in the U.K. in their investigation into the attacks on the U.K. retailers M&amp;S, Co-Op and Harrods.
        </p>
        <p>
            The NCA published an initial confirmation of the arrests on the 10th, stating:<br/>
            &quot;Two males aged 19, another aged 17, and a 20-year-old female were apprehended in the West Midlands and London this morning (10 July) on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, blackmail, money laundering and participating in the activities of an organised crime group.
            <br/>All four were arrested at their home addresses and had their electronic devices seized for digital forensic analysis.
            <br/>They remain in custody for questioning by officers from the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit in relation to the three attacks, which took place in April this year.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Details been limited  and thin on the ground with no further official updates as the investigation progresses, however Brian Krebs has 
            <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/07/uk-charges-four-in-scattered-spider-ransom-group/" target="krebWindow">posted an update</a> in which he has discovered the 
            names of two of the 19-year-old individuals: Owen David Flowers (aka bo764, Holy, and Nazi) and Thalha Jubair (aka Earth2Star and Operator).
        </p>
        <p>
            Both individuals are linked to the Scattered Spider group, with Thala also linked to LAPSUS$. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Scattered Spider is part of &quot;The Com&quot; (short for &quot;The Community&quot;), a broad collective of cybercriminals responsible for a range of crimes, including social engineering, 
            phishing, SIM swapping, extortion, sextortion, swatting, kidnapping, and murder. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The migration from online tooling hidden behind layers of obfuscation to telephone-based vectors has proved successful in recent social engineering attacks on 
            businesses, however it exposes the perpetrators to digital voiceprinting analysis. It would seem that the groups either do not care about this threat to the 
            members carrying out the social engineering, or they believe the threat to be meaningless due to their ages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The newer cybercrime groups have all been noted to target younger individuals in their teens for recruitment, with the teenagers believing it's a quick and safe 
            way to make some money. Despite their underage antics, they are increasingly discovering it's a quick way to land yourself with a visit from the NCA or FBI and a permenant record on your file. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As we await further information from the NCA, it is likely we will see continued arrests across the world in relation to the acivities of the groups.

        <h3>Browser Extension Data Leak</h3>
        <p>
            It's another day, another coffee spitting vulnerability on your user's machines. This one rides in their browsers and has been hidden in 
            browser extensions that have been verified for years in App stores.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the automatic update mechanisms for browser extensions, the malicious versions silently deployed to over 2.3 million users, turning an 
            innocent extension into something that could capture and redirect traffic and send data from your sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exploiting the trusted rating, positive reviews and huge download figures for each extension, the malware has made it's way onto many devices, 
            providing a rich data set for attackers and the potential for massive man-in-the-middle attacks on unsuspecting users.
        </p>
        <p>
            The advice as always is to check extensions installed in your browser (and remove them if they exist), then clear-out browser data to destroy tracking data and 
            run full malware sweeps of your machine.
        </p>

        <h3>Citrix Bleeds Again</h3>
        <p>
            Citrix Netscaler has been in the feeds again this week with two vulnerabilities being actively exploited in the world wild web.
        </p>
        <p>
            CVE-2025-5777 and CVE-2025-6543 are proving that Arnie was right in Predator - &quot;If it bleeds, we can kill it&quot;. Well, perhaps not kill 
            the Netscaler, but make it hemorrhage data from memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            CVE-2025-5777 is particularly fun according to <a href="https://labs.watchtowr.com/how-much-more-must-we-bleed-citrix-netscaler-memory-disclosure-citrixbleed-2-cve-2025-5777/" target="watchtowr">Watchtowr's lab analysis</a>, 
            showing that simple request replays with crafted input parameters can spit memory contents back at you. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It appears that the Citrix team potentially have uninitialised local variables in the authentication processing which is handing back random pieces of data from memory. Whilst it's important 
            to note that you cannot request specific memory locations, the repeated requests to a live, active system could yeild important information from other users 
            on VPN connections. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Defensive coding practices are designed to mitigate against this sort of issue, ensuring variables are nulled and memory pointers aren't left opening doors to data.
        </p>
        <p>
            As always, check your patch status and stem the bleeding.

        <h3>Critical Sudo Vulnerability</h3>
        <p>
            Two critical flaws in Linux's sudo command-line utility have been discovered, long undiscovered since their introduction into the software in 2013.
        </p>
        <p>
            CVE-2025-32462 and the more worrying CVE-2025-32463 are credited with discovery to Stratascale researcher Rich Mirch and said CVE-2025-32462 has managed to slip 
            through the cracks for over 12 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tooted in the sudo -h option making it possible to list a user's sudo privileges on a different host, it was possible to execute any command allowed by the 
            remote host to be run on the local machine as well when running the sudo command with the host option referencing an unrelated remote host.
        </p>
        <p>
            CVE-2025-32463 leverages sudo -r to run arbitrary commands as root, even if the user is not listed in the sudoers file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following their responsible disclosure on April, the vulnerabilities have been addressed in sudo version 1.9.17p1 which was released on June 30th. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Any vulnerable version prior to 1.9.17p1 can potentially escalate privileges to root for any local unprivileged user. Users are advised to patch with the latest software.

        <h3>Qantas airlines suffers Data Breach</h3>
        <p>
            The Australian airline, Qantas has notified the Australian Federal Police of a serious data breach in one of it's contact centres. 
            Used for customer services, the system holds data on six million people including the name, address, contact number, birth date and frequent flyer numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thankfully the system does not hold financial or passport information and is related to the third-party support centre. Qantas is still investigating 
            the extent of the breach along with authorities, on the back of similar incidents taking place with Hawaiian Airlines and Canada's WestJet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attacks are believed to be from the cyber criminal group, Scattered Spider, who often lean heavily on social engineering to convince staff to 
            register rogue multifactor authentication devices. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The FBI recently formally warned the airline industry of the threat of targetted attacks on their services and the Australian Privacy Commissioner, Carly Kind, 
            urged businesses and government agencies to step up security measures and data protection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attack continues to highlight the need for staff training and processes in place to protect against social engineering and side-chain attacks aimed at 
            negating the main security layers.

        <h3>No Digital Ceasefire in World Conflicts</h3>
        <p>
            In the wake of the tensions between Israel and Iran, the former NATO hacker, Candan Bolukbas ( CTO and founder of Black Kite ) has warned 
            &quot;In the cyber world, there's no such thing as a ceasefire&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bolukbas has raised concerns of Iran continuing to target supply chains of Israel and the U.S. DoD suppliers to find an exploitable vector in 
            retaliation to the events in the Middle East.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;My belief is that they're going to go after the supply chain, because that's our weak spot&quot; Bolukbas said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst countries may have a physical ceasefire in operation, the digital realm continues to see ongoing hostility between nations as each tries to 
            find leverage in the event of escalation.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;The US has the biggest cyber army, strategic or talent-wise, the NSA is known for having the biggest zero-day arsenal on the planet. We have a doctrine 
            on something called defense forward that says if we see something in cyberspace that can disrupt us, we're going to attack it first, and we have that under US Cyber Command's mission.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The advise to those outside the milirary trying to hold our networks and systems together? 
            <ul>
            <li>&quot;Be careful with phishing attacks, that's very common because Iran doesn't have a lot of zero days, so they go heavy on social attacks. Be careful what you're clicking on.&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;Patch your systems, including IoT for end users and residential people,&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;Patch your external-facing systems quickly, not a week or 10 days or a month later, because time is ticking from the day that the vulnerability is disclosed. Iranian groups are trying to develop an exploit.&quot;</li>
            </ul>
            &quot;If they develop the exploit before the patch, they're not going to hesitate to use that.&quot;
        </p>

        <h3>Glasgow City Council Suffers Cyber Attack</h3>
        <p>
            On Thursday 19th June, Glasgow City Council's ICT supplier (CGI) discovered malicious activity on servers managed by a third-party supplier.  This may or may not include the theft 
            of customer data in the process. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The resulting tear-down of the affected servers for investigation has caused widespread service access issues, leading to the loss of a range of day-to-day online processes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The notification from the Council states &quot;We are conducting an investigation into the incident, alongside Police Scotland, the Scottish Cyber Coordination Centre (SC3) and the National Cyber Security Centre.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;At this stage we can't confirm whether data has actually been removed and, if so, what that data is. As a precaution, we are operating on the presumption that customer data related to the currently unavailable web forms may have been exfiltrated, 
            and we have contacted the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on this basis. No council financial systems have been affected in this attack and no details of bank accounts or credit/debit cards processed by those systems have been compromised. &quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The council services across the United Kingdom have encountered a slew of cyber attacks in recent years, with the most vulnerable in the local community the most affected.
        </p>
        <p>
            The incident again highlights the increasing popularity of side-chain attacks and the lack of security around council-run services.
