        <h3>MongoDB Bleeds Memory Data</h3>
        <p>
            A flaw in Zlib compression protocol header length ( <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14847" target="CVEWin">CVE-2025-14847</a> ) which is utilised by default 
            in MongoDB can return uninitialized heap memory without authenticating to the server. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Tracked by MongoDB and thankfully with a patch available ( <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-115508" target="MongoWin">MongoDB Jira Ticket</a>), the MongoDB team urge 
            users to patch immediately even though there are no <em>current reports</em> of active exploitation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This data leak vulnerability affects the following versions:
            <ul>
                <li>MongoDB 8.2.0 through 8.2.3</li>
                <li>MongoDB 8.0.0 through 8.0.16</li>
                <li>MongoDB 7.0.0 through 7.0.26</li>
                <li>MongoDB 6.0.0 through 6.0.26</li>
                <li>MongoDB 5.0.0 through 5.0.31</li>
                <li>MongoDB 4.4.0 through 4.4.29</li>
                <li>All MongoDB Server v4.2 versions</li>
                <li>All MongoDB Server v4.0 versions</li>
                <li>All MongoDB Server v3.6 versions</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The team have also advised &quot;If you cannot upgrade immediately, disable zlib compression on the MongoDB Server by 
            starting mongod or mongos with a networkMessageCompressors or a net.compression.compressors option that explicitly omits 
            zlib. Example safe values include snappy,zstd or disabled&quot;

        <h3>Cisco AsyncOS Zero Day</h3>
        <p>
            'Twas the week before Christmas and all through the NOC, Cisco Admins were screaming and Criminals running amok.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco have <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sma-attack-N9bf4">announced a critical vulnerability</a> in the AsyncOS software under active exploitation by Chinese APT's. The attack campaign 
            affects Cisco Secure Email Gateway systems (physical AND virtual) and Cisco Secure Web Manager appliances (physical AND virtual) of <strong>ALL release versions</strong> 
            when these conditions are met:
            <ul>
                <li>The appliance is configured with the Spam Quarantine feature</li>
                <li>The Spam Quarantine feature is exposed to and reachable from the Internet</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco have uncovered exploitation dating back to at least late November 2025 with the vulnerability being used to drop tunneling tools like ReverseSSH and Chisel. A lightweight Python backdoor has been also seen 
            capable of receiving encoded commands and executing them. The CVE ( CVE-2025-20393 ) has a rating score of 10.0 and in the absence of a patch, 
            administrators are being urged to restore their appliances to a secure configuration; limit access from the Internet; secure devices behind a firewall and only allow traffic from trusted hosts; 
            separate mail and management functionality onto a separate network interface; monitor web log traffic for unexpected traffic and disable HTTP for the main administration portal.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, Season's greetings, admin teams - I hope you didn't have any plans for this weekend.

        <h3>New AWS Crypto Miner attack</h3>
        <p>
            It's been a thorn in the side for AWS-based companies for at least ten years now, and it's taken an interesting new turn. The deployment of 
            crypto mining infrastructure from exposed or stolen keys has been a vast financial sink hole for countless companies, but 
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/cryptomining-campaign-targeting-amazon-ec2-and-amazon-ecs/" target="AWSwin" >Amazon have uncovered </a>
            a new variant which has a sneaky attack mode targeting EC2 and ECS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a key has been swiped by the criminal, resources and permissions are quickly enumerated before deploying the crypto mining resources across EC2 and ECS. 
            The multi-stage attack begins with a discovery phase, running probes with the stolen IAM credentials to test permissions by using the --DryRun flag. This enables 
            the attacker to validate IAM permissions without launching infrastructure, avoiding cost increase triggers and minimising forensic evidence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The process continues with a CreateServiceLinkedRole and CreateRole phase to generate IAM roles for autoscaling groups and AWS Lambda, then attaching the 
            AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole policy. The ECS clusters deployed then register a malicious DockerHub image ( yenik65958/secret:user ) , creating a service using the 
            task definition to initiate crypto mining on ECS Fargate nodes. The DockerHub image has been thankfully taken down ( after over 100,000 pulls ), however the data 
            shows it configured to initiate a shell script on launch to start cryptocurrency mining using the RandomVIREL mining algorithm. The threat actor has also been observed 
            to exploit EC2 service quotas to maximise resource consumption with scaling between 20 and 999 instances, targeting both high-performance GPU and machine learning 
            instances as well as compute, memory and GP instances.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attack also stands out for it's use of the ModifyInstanceAttribute action to enable termination protection, preventing instances from being terminated using the 
            EC2 console, CLI or API. This action makes response to the incident more involved and shows an understanding of the standard clean-up practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amazon reccomends GuardDuty is in place and enabled on all accounts and regions with Runtime monitoring enabled, along with integration to the Security Hub. As always, 
            strong IAM controls are critically important with temporary keys instead of long-term access keys and enforced MFA on all accounts. Least privilege permissions should be 
            the default as always and ship those logs to review easily as necessary by your teams!

        <h3>React2Shell Attacks Accelerate</h3>
        <p>
            The React2Shell server-side vulnerability ( CVE-2025-55182 ) that dropped this month is quickly becoming a growing issue for sites across the Internet. With the 
            React Server Components and dependent frameworks ( such as Next.js ) being so utilised across websites, this vulnerability is a huge concern. The unsafe 
            deserialisation allows unauthenticated attackers to send crafted requests to achieve remote code execution. A single exposed endpoint can provide an entry point to 
            larger estates, particularly worrying for multi-hosting servers. 
        </p>

            insights into the observed groups exploiting the vulnerability in the wild.
        </p>

            It would appear that a lot of sites are still wide open and vulnerable to the exploit, which (if you haven't patched yet) you should consider pwn3d.

        <h3>Another Chrome &quot;Patch Now&quot; Drop</h3>
        <p>
            Google have pushed security updates for the Chrome browser to fix <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/12/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_10.html" target="ChromeWin">three security flaws</a> with one being found under active exploitation. The team 
            are keeping the details under close guard until enough of the userbase has upgraded to the latest patched versions.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The update <strong>143.0.7499.109/.110</strong> on Windows or Mac and <strong>143.0.7499.109</strong> on Linux are the current patched versions. It's important to ensure you run the update as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            This update takes the quantity of zero-day flaws to eight this year. Thankfully the security teams are actively engaged in seeking and resolving issues before they reach the stable channel. The latest updates continue 
            to prove that continuous patching cycles are necessary to maintain a strong security posture.

        <h3>Cloudflare Mitigates Largest Ever (so far) DDoS</h3>
        <p>
            Cloudflare have announced they detected and mitigated the largest ever (so far) DDoS measuring 29.7 terabits per second. Originating from a DDoS 
            botnet-for-hire known as AISURU, the attack lasted for 69 seconds. Cloudflare did not disclose the target of this attack.
        </p>
        <p>
            The AISURU botnet has prominently targeted telecoms providers, hosting providers, gaming companies and financial services. The attack was 
            UDP bombarding an average of 15,000 destination ports per second, randomising various packet attributes in an attempt to evade detection and defences.
        </p>
        <p>
            The growing DDoS problem has been seen hand-in-hand with the increase in malware, targeting and infecting as many devices as possible to utilise in these attacks. The usual kudos for 
            having the largest botnet army is high on the agenda - more bots equals more likelyhood of causing issues for targets, equals higher price for hire.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite mitigating the incident in this battle, the war is yet to be over and we are likely to see an increased quantity of these high figure attacks in 2026.

        <h3>NPM Woes Continue</h3>
        <p>
            I'd like to say this was just the Annus Horribilis for Node Package Manager, but I fear this is just the shape of things to come for the forseeable future. In today's 
            ongoing saga of issues, North Korean threat actors behind the Contagious Interview campaign spammed the npm registry with 197 more malicious packages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team at <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/north-korea-contagious-interview-npm-attacks" target="SocketWin">Socket</a> have been tracking the progress of the 
            npm attacks which are designed to deliver a variant of OtterCookie. Once launched, the software attempts to evade any sandboxes and virtual machines, profiles the machine 
            and establishes a command and control channel to provide the attackers with a remote shell, along with the ability to steal clipboard contents, log keystrokes, capture 
            screenshots, gather browser credentials, documents, cryptocurrency wallet data and seed phrases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The utilisation of these types of package attacks are likely to cause significant damage as they are being coupled with fake interview processes, a recent tactic to get 
            developers to install and run code on their systems in the hope of completing technical assessment to secure a new role. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's that time of year whereby people consider where they're heading in their career and starting to look elsewhere - just the ideal time for the threat actors to 
            pretend to be a recruitment agency and have developers install malware. If that's undertaken on workplace machines, it might cause significant compromise or data theft 
            at a time when teams are trying to wind-down for the holidays.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll have to see what further npm headlines appear in the first few months of 2026.

        <h3>JSONformatter and CodeBeautify Data Leaks</h3>
        <p>
            You would have thought in the current climate of security consciousness that users would have enough savvy to not just blindly paste information into 
            websites online that reformat and provide that information back on an open-access link, but you'd be wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the continuing case of &quot;finding new ways to exfiltrate data by oblivious stupidity&quot;, years of corporate data has been found to have leaked (and remains) 
            on the online tool sites JSONformatter and CodeBeautify. Cybersecurity company watchTowr Labs <a href="https://labs.watchtowr.com/stop-putting-your-passwords-into-random-website" target="watchTowrWin">captured a dataset</a> of over 80,000 files which contained: usernames and passwords; 
            repository authentication keys; Active Directory, Database and FTP credentials; Cloud keys; LDAP configuration inforamtion; helpdesk API keys; meeting room API keys; SSH session 
            recordings and all manner of personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, just a few items of interest, then.
        </p>
        <p>
            One might consider that the data might be limited to developers running some early-doors testing, however the companies affected span critical national infrastructure, 
            government, finance, insurance, banking, technology, retail, aerospace, telecommunications, healthcare, education, travel and cybersecurity sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, let's just say, the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            In modern news there is so much emphasis placed on elite hackers breaking through tiny cracks in firewalls or security systems, whilst it appears a simple script scanning across online tooling 
            can provide more readily availale data. This isn't so much a back door as a thousand acre farm with an &quot;Open All Hours&quot; neon sign at the open entrance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Excuse me, I'm off to rotate all my corporate and personal data in case someone thought it was useful to paste bin my life...

        <h3>U.S. Worker guilty of sabotage on ex-employer</h3>
        <p>
            A U.S. worker in Ohio has pleaded guilty of sabotaging his ex-employer's computer systems causing $862,000 worth of damage. The 35-year old contractor, 
            Maxwell Shultz, impersonated another contractor to operate powershell scripts and attempt to cover his tracks by removing logs after being 
            fired from the unnamed company.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scripts reset the passwords to around 2,500 accounts on the system and caused the stated damage cost in downtime, disruption to customer services and 
            remediation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Maxwell will be sentenced at the end of January, facing up to ten years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet another case of disgruntled employees with too much access to systems highlights the need to have sanitation routines on passwords, keys and systems when 
            offboarding employees with wide-ranging access.

        <h3>Claude AI used for cyber espionage</h3>
        <p>
           In a <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf">security report from Anthropic</a>  the first catalogued usage of AI tools 
           to attempt access to over thirty high-profile companies and government organisations. In some cases, the attacks was successful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traced-back to a Chinese state-sponsored group, the attackers used Claude Code and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to run the attacks without a human in the tactical execution loop. 
            A human-developed framework utilised Claude to orchestrate multi-stage attacks, which were then in-turn carried out by several Claude sub-agents, all performing specific tasks. 
            Once the sub-agents had developed exploit chains and their associated custom payloads, human operators spent between two and ten minutes reviewing the results of the AI's actions, then signing-off on the subsequent exploitations.
            The sub-agents ran to find and validate credentials, escalate privileges, moving laterally across the network, accessing and then stealing sensitive data. Post-exploitation, the human operator only had to again review the AI's 
            work before approving the final data exfiltration.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;While we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale&quot; states Anthropic's new analysis. As with standard AI, it &quot;requently overstated findings and occasionally 
            fabricated data during autonomous operations&quot;. So, it's not just normal development teams suffering from the cocky and erroneous &quot;I'm amazing!&quot; responses from AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            It may be the first documented case, but with the rise of automated systems it is unlikely to be the solitary example in the news.

        <h3>Cisco Firewall Ongoing Attacks</h3>
        <p>
           Continuing on from the previous Cisco vulnerability in the wild reports, Cisco have uncovered an ongoing attack against Secure ASA Software or Cisco 
           Secure FTD Software releases affected by CVE-2025-20333 and CVE-2025-20362.
        </p>
        <p>
            The CVE's, which were patched in September after Cisco worked for several months with government agencies to investigate attacks on equipment, can lead 
            to equipment being forced in a reboot cycle. In some cases, the ROMmon has been modified to estblish persistent connections to equipment even after rebooting 
            or software upgrades.
        </p>
        <p>
            The advice is clear and urgent - patch now. Cisco have more details on their <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/asa_ftd_continued_attacks" target="CiscoWin">security advisory</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco also notified customers that they have discovered two critical security holes in the contact centre software, tracked as CVE-2025-20354 and CVE-2025-20358. They affect Cisco Unified CCX, regardless of device configuration 
            and allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files; execute commands with root privileges; or bypass authentication to run scripts as a non-root user.
        </p>
        <p>
            In plain terms, if you can't patch your systems, consider the hardware compromised or compromisable. If you have the ability, patch everything right now - turn off features or replace ageing equipment.

        <h3>Canadian Infrastructure Hack</h3>
        <p>
            The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security <a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/alerts-advisories/al25-016-internet-accessible-industrial-control-systems-ics-abused-hacktivists" target="CanadaWin">issued an alert</a> to raise 
            awareness of a cyber threat impacting critical infrastructure across Canada. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hacktivists have managed to breach municipal water facility systems along with an Oil and Gas company. In an effort to raise awareness of their own cause, the Hacktivists tampered with 
            settings and guage readings at facilities, thankfully not causing major incidents or injury/death. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security warns that the attack highlights the failings to secure critical national infrastructure, with the usual suspects of Internet connected systems that 
            are vulnerable, open, or not adequately patched. PLC's, remote terminal units, human-machine interfaces, SCADA systems, safety controllers, building management setups and other IoT equipment 
            left exposed and open to tamper from anyone on the Internet. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Companies providing critical infrastructure and services must take stock of their systems and access points into the equipment they operate, or the next time it might not be 
            a Hacktivist group raising awareness, but a nation state taking-out adversaries.

        <h3>Docker Vulnerabilties</h3>
        <p>
            Another day, another set of patching to undertake on your development systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            A new vulnerability in Docker Compose (CVE-2025-62725) has been given an 8.9 severity rating. Uncovered by Imperva's Ron Masas, the path-traversal 
            vulnerability allows attackers to escape Compose's cache directory and write arbitrary files onto the host system. The vulnerability comes through a 
            recently added support for OCI-based Compose artifacts. Users are recommended to upgrade to v2.40.2 of Docker Compose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Docker has also fixed a flaw in the Windows installer that left it vulnerabile to DLL injection. ENISA tracked the issue as EUVD-2025-36191 with an 8.8 rating. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The flaw in the installer allowed SLL hijacking due to insecure DLL search orders - at a time when DLL hijacking and injection has been a favourite of cybercriminal groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Patched in Desktop 4.49.0, users are encouraged to upgrade if they haven't already. The release notes also warn the next release onwards requires at least Windows 10 22H2 or Windows 11 23H2 
            which could impact users on certain patch cycles.

        <h3>European Telco Compromised</h3>
        <p>
            The research team at Darktrace have uncovered activity in a European telecommunications organisation (currently no name shared) that matches 
            patterns with the China-linked cyber espionage group Salt Typhoon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nathaniel Jones, Darktrace's vice president of security and AI strategy and field CISO along with Sam Lister, specialist security researcher at Darktrace 
            published a blog post detailing some of the insights gained: &quot;The intrusion likely began with the exploitation of a Citrix NetScaler Gateway appliance 
            in early July 2025... from there, the actor pivoted to Citrix Virtual Delivery Agent hosts in the client's Machine Creation Services subnet.... Initial access 
            activities in the intrusion originated from an endpoint potentially associated with the SoftEther VPN service, suggesting infrastructure obfuscation from the outset&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Darktrace observed the threat actor delivering a backdoor likely to be SNAPPYBEE to multiple Citrix VDA hosts, delivered as a DLL alongside legitimate 
            executable files for antivirus software such as Norton and Bkav and IObit Malware Fighter.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The Salt Typhoon group has a record of persistently evading detection while maintaining access to sensitive environments using a range of obfuscation techniques and 
            zero-day exploits. It serves as a constant reminder to patch early and employ proactive, intelligence-driven defense strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not the first telecommunications provider that the group has gone after and exploited and it is unlikely to be the last.

        <h3>F5 Compromised</h3>
        <p>
            US security company, F5, has <a href="https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000154696" target="F5win">issued a statement</a> stating it has had their systems 
            compromised and data exfiltrated. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The information taken from their systems includes a portion of the BIG-IP software codebase and vulnerability information which could lead to 
            discovery of exploits in the hardware and software provided by F5. Affected Hardware F5 products include: BIG-IP iSeries, rSeries, or any other F5 device that has reached end of support, 
            with software affected including all devices running BIG-IP (F5OS), BIG-IP (TMOS), Virtual Edition (VE), BIG IP Next, BIG- IQ, and BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes (BNK) / Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNF)
        </p>
        <p>
            F5 states: <br/>
            &quot;...we learned a highly sophisticated nation-state threat actor maintained long-term, persistent access to, and downloaded files from, certain F5 systems. These systems included our BIG-IP product development environment and engineering knowledge management platforms...&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;We have no evidence of access to, or exfiltration of, data from our CRM, financial, support case management, or iHealth systems. However, some of the exfiltrated files from our knowledge management platform contained configuration or implementation information for a small 
            percentage of customers. We are currently reviewing these files and will be communicating with affected customers directly as appropriate.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            In a change to recent global patterns of compromise, this doesn't appear to be a supply-chain attack and from their assessment appears to be a very targeted attack aimed at gaining knowledge on 
            the BIG-IP software from F5. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Management interfaces customers may have exposed to the Internet should be switced-off and the latest updates applied to systems. It is likely that F5 systems will be targeted increasingly and any 
            attack surface open to the world will be prodded to discover possible weaknesses, therefore F5 have advised utilisation of SIEM tooling to monitor activity to and from your devices.

            You put your hack crew in, you take your hack crew out, in out, in out, rattle sabres all about...
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, the hokey cokey... they're in they're out, they're back, they're scattering into the dark... it's the unusual and confusing world 
            of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters group where they come out of retirement to head back into it again. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems the group are having some tête-à-tête with the FBI after recent high-level attacks on systems and subsequent arrests and investigations. Formed 
            as an amalgamation of key members from Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and Shiny Hunters, the group has come under scrutiny again due to recent data drops from companies including Qantas, 
            Vietnam Airlines, Gap, and Fujifilm.
        </p>
        <p>
            The group stated in their usual &lt;sarcasm&gt;charming&lt;/sarcasm&gt; way:<br/>
            &quot;As per the exceptional circumstances by which the FBI tried to obliterate our legacy, we've exceptionally decided to 
            temporarily renounce to oblivion ... and promptly hack them back ... We shall now dissolve again in the ether. Good night.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            As with all of the groups, there will be internal politics and power struggles along with grudges against agencies and personnel. How this plays out over 
            the next few months will be seen in time, but for now, perhaps, maybe, possibly, they're hiding in the dark corners again - watching, waiting, listening..

        <h3>Discord Information leaked</h3>
        <p>
            Well, well, well, if it isn't the consequences of enforced age verification decisions coming back to bite you... brace for more of this over the coming 
            weeks, months and years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discord has said around 70,000 users have had their data potentially leaked by a company that was contracted to undertake age verification. The 
            information leaked includes photographs for age verification, personal details, support team chat information and partial credit card details. So just 
            a few things to be concerned about.
        </p>
        <p>
            Affected users have been contacted by Discord and the (surprise, surprise) third-party that was connected to Discord's systems has had access removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again we see the side-chain attack in full flow with outsourced support companies failing in their duty to protect information. The list of companies 
            affected by this type of attack is growing daily.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the requirement for age verification firmly in place on many services, there is a need for the service providers to step-up their security. The 
            rush to implement providers will undoubtedly have led to cost saving at the detriment to security.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's see what the actual toll is on Discord and which provider will be the next leaky bucket.

        <h3>Metropolitan Police arrest suspected nursery group hackers</h3>
        <p>
            The Metropolitan Police have confirmed they have arrested two 17-year-old individuals in the ongoing investigation into the 
            Kido chain nursery hack that saw the names, addresses and photographs of children and their parents stolen in late September.
        </p>
        <p>
            The hackers initially demanded a ransom of around £600,000 in Bitcoin to not release the details and began a campaign of contacting 
            parents in the list to have them pressurise the nursery chain. When ransom money was seen to be not forthcoming the hackers began to 
            publish the images and addresses of children in their data. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If not already calous enough in setting a nursery as a target, this act of seems to have tipped the scales heavily against the criminals 
            with the group suddenly blurring imagery on their site seemingly worried about negative reputation with other hacker groups. 
        </p>
        <p>
           On the 2nd October the hackers suddenly removed all the stolen data and pictures from their site, claiming to have deleted all 8,000 files stating &quot;No more remains and this can comfort parents&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
           Was it external pressure from other groups, concern over the backlash in the media or some flake of moral concern? As yet we'll have to speculate.
        </p>
        <p>
           The Metropolitan Police confirmed the hackers were arrested at residential addresses in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, on suspicion of computer misuse and blackmail. The investigation continues.

            stating it has banned ChatGPT accounts it believes to be linked to Chinese government entities attempting to use AI models to generate 
            surveillance software.
        </p>
        <p>
            The users, now banned, were suspected to be utilising a VPN service to access the AI software from China. In one account, their requests to the AI models  
            were seen to be asking it to design promotional materials and project plans for a social media listening tool, described as a &quot;probe&quot; that could 
            scan X, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok and YouTube for what the user described as extermist speech, ethnic, religious and political content.
        </p>
        <p>
            The principal investigator on OpenAI's intelligence and investigations team said 
            &quot;What we saw and banned in those cases was typically threat actors asking ChatGPT to help put together plans or documentation for AI-powered tools, but not then to implement them.&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company also banned one user who asked ChatGPT to identify funding sources for an X account that criticised the Chinese government, and another who asked ChatGPT to identify organizers of a petition in Mongolia
        </p>
        <p>
            Michael Flossman, who leads OpenAI's threat intelligence team said &quot;One China-linked cluster that we investigated, for example, used ChatGPT to draft phishing lures and then explored another model, DeepSeek, to automate mass targeting,&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
           China isn't alone in being banned as OpenAI has also seen system abuse originating from Russia asking the model to develop and refine malware, including remote access tojans, 
           credential stealers and features to help malware evade detection.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI is a growing concern for data exfiltration and as a weaponised tool allowing those who would normally be incapable of generating malware and campaigns the means to 
            quickly and easily generate systems. We can only hope that the teams continue to implement stronger guard-rails and keep on top of security issues as we get to grips with 
            the automated future we've released on ourselves.

        <h3>Malicious Python Package</h3>
        <p>
            A malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository has been caught and removed, but downloaded 2653 times since it appeared on the 26th September. 
            Claiming to offer a SOCKS5 proxy service, it included malicious functionality to provide stealthy backdoors to Windows to enable the drop of additional payloads 
            onto the machine.
        </p>
        <p>
            JFrog's security research team provided a <a href="https://research.jfrog.com/post/check-your-socks-a-deep-dive-into-soopsocks-pypi/" target="JFROGWin">full breakdown of the package</a> citing:
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;The SoopSocks PyPI package (XRAY-725599) promises to create a SOCKS5 proxy service and report information about the server to a configurable Discord webhook, supporting fallback as a 
            scheduled task. While providing this capability it exhibits behaviour as a Backdoor proxy server, targeting Windows platforms, using automated installation processes via VBScript or 
            an executable version.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The malicious package included privilege escalation and reconnaissance capabilities, making it a danger to developer systems and servers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The team reported the package to maintainers after their analysis, and it was subsequently removed from PyPI on Sep 29, 18:00 GMT+3.

        <h3>Cisco Vulnerbility Actively Exploited</h3>
        <p>
            The recently disclosed Cisco Vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-20333 and CVE-2025-20362) allowing access to endpoints and execution of code is now 
            being actively exploited to deploy malware components such as LINE VIPER and RayInitiator, the 
            <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/persistent-malicious-targeting-cisco-devices" target="NCSCWin">NCSC have stated</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco have warned vendors that &quot;"Attackers were observed to have exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities and employed advanced evasion techniques such as disabling logging, intercepting CLI commands, 
            and intentionally crashing devices to prevent diagnostic analysis&quot;. There have been noted incidents where ROMMON has been modified to persist modifications after a reboot or software update.
        </p>
        <p>
            ASA 5500-X Series models running Cisco ASA Software releases 9.12 or 9.14 with VPN web services enabled, and which do not support Secure Boot and Trust Anchor technologies have been compromised 
            in this latest vulnerability attack. All of the affected devices have reached end-of-support (EoS) or are about to reach EoS status by next week including:<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>5512-X</li>
                <li>5515-X</li>
                <li>5525-X</li>
                <li>5545-X</li>
                <li>5555-X</li>
                <li>5585-X</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            NCSC are urging network vendors to verify their traffic and systems, remediate through patching and potentially replace anything that is heading to EoL. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;It is critical for organisations to take note of the recommended actions highlighted by Cisco today, particularly on detection and remediation&quot;, said 
            Ollie Whitehouse, the NCSC CTO. &quot;We strongly encourage network defenders to follow vendor best practices and engage with the NCSC's malware analysis report to assist with their investigations.<br/>
            End-of-life technology presents a significant risk for organisations. Systems and devices should be promptly migrated to modern versions to address vulnerabilities and strengthen resilience.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the wide usage of the devices it is likely that we'll see an increase in compromise reports over the coming weeks.

        <h3>European Airport Hacker Nabbed by NCA</h3>
        <p>
            The National Crime Agency have arrested a man in West Sussex in connection with the European airport system hack that brought air travel to 
            a grinding halt at the weekend and continues to cause issues into this week.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attack against the Collins Aerospace technology check-in system caused widespread issues, travel problems and delays across Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Officers from the NCA supported by the regional crimes unit arrested the man in his 40's on Tuesday evening on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences. 
            He has subsequently been released on conditional bail.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing.&quot; said NCA deputy director, 
            Paul Foster (head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit). &quot;Cybercrime is a persistent global threat that continues to cause significant disruption to the UK. 
            Alongside our partners here and overseas, the NCA is committed to reducing that threat in order to protect the British public&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The investigation into the inicident continues with no specific cybercriminal gang claiming responsibility for the action as yet. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As reiterated many times over the course of recent incidents, this sort of attack will continue and persistently prove that infrastructure is vulnerable to outside 
            influences and attack. We will no doubt hear of further results from the investigation in due course.

        <h3>European Airport Check-in System Hacked</h3>
        <p>
            Airlines have been pushed into chaos this weekend with flights delayed due to centralised software, Muse, which is operated by RTX (who owns software provider Collins Aerospace) 
            enduring a &quot;cyber-related disruption&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations.&quot; RTX commented. Customers trying to 
            meet connections have found the delays have hindered or cancelled their ongoing journeys.
        </p>
        <p>
            Heathrow, Dublin and several other airports have had to delay flights and switch to manual check-in processes to try to keep the lines of customers moving. In several airports customers 
            have been left stranded as flights are delayed, rescheduled or cancelled and journeys put on hold.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than noting the software affected, Collins Aerospace have yet to comment publicly about the nature or origin of the hack, leaving speculation as to the cause ranging from 
            ransomware to the loss of access to systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the recent incursion into foreign airspace by Russia this week, there is a heightened nervousness around the origin of this incident.

        <h3>Chrome High Severity Patch</h3>
        <p>
            Chrome has had a high severity patch pushed by Google which is under active exploitation. If you haven't already, now is the time to run updates in your 
            browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flaw in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, tracked as CVE-2025-10585, is a type confusion bug where the engine misinterprets a block of memory 
            as one type of object when it's actually something else. This flaw can lead to system crashes, arbitrary code execution, and when chained with other outstanding issues, 
            potential full system compromise via a malicious HTML page.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flaw was discovered and reported by the Google Threat Analysis Group and a patch for Windows, Apple and Linux environments is available now.

        <h3>TfL Hackers Charged</h3>
        <p>
            The National Crime Agency (NCA) in the UK <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/two-charged-for-tfl-cyber-attack" target="NCAWin">have announced</a> 
            that two men have been charged for the Transport for London (TfL) network intrusion on the 31st August 2024, believed to have been carried out by members of Scattered Spider.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thalha Jubair (19) and Owen Flowers (18) were arrested at their home addresses on Tuesday 16th September and appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court on the 18th 
            September after the Crown Prosecution Service authorised they be charged with conspiring together to commit unauthorised acts against TfL under the Computer Misuse Act.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flowers was initially arrested for the TfL attack on the 6th September 2024, whereby NCA officers identified further potential evidence of offences against US healthcare companies. 
            Flowers has therefore been also charged with conspiring with others to infiltrate and damage the networks of SSM Health Care Corporation and attempting to do the same to 
            Sutter Health's networks, both in the U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jubair has been additionally charged under RIPA for failing to disclose the pin or passwords for devices seized from him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both individuals will appear at the Crown Court on the 16th October 2025. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hannah Von Dadelszen, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS said:<br/>
            &quot;The Crown Prosecution Service has decided to prosecute Thalha Jubair and Owen Flowers with computer misuse and fraud related charges - following a National Crime Agency 
            investigation into a cyber-attack on the Transport for London network. Our prosecutors have worked to establish that there is sufficient evidence to bring the case to trial and that 
            it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings. We have worked closely with the National Crime Agency as they carried out their investigation.&quot;

        <h3>NPM SBoM check System ( Part 2 )</h3>
        <p>
            On the back of the <a href="https://thecloudhacker.co.uk/articles/2025/20250917-franticDev.htm">recent frantic dev process</a> to verify our Software Bill of Materials, I ended up rejigging some hacked together code and 
            providing it on my <a href="https://github.com/thecloudhacker/sboms" target="SBOMGitWin">Github Site</a> in the hope it's of use to others.
        </p>
        <p>
            The codebase is a <strong>quick and dirty hack</strong>, so don't start hosting it on external endpoints as I've not run any testing against it and I know there's some older packages on there.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will need to generate your own SBOM files before using the process, there's a bunch of tooling to provide that for you available online. Once you have that, then throw the sbom at the searcher.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyhow... there we have it. This was a week that was. I'm sure there will be plenty more weeks like this in the months and years ahead.

        <h3>NPM SBoM Check</h3>
        <p>
            The ever growing <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/ongoing-supply-chain-attack-targets-crowdstrike-npm-packages" target="SocketWin">list of compromised NPM packages</a> (thank you, Socket, for tracking this!) 
            is causing a pain to keep up with alongside work, and despite having a nice SBoM output from my dev teams, trying to manually keep up with checking was somewhat of a manual headache... especially after a huge deluge 
            of compromised items into the list.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cue several hours of scraping data from the 'net and some janky dev work on my side... 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've pulled together a very quick and dirty system with worker functions and a web interface to help keep track of my system status. With the ability to throw a CSV of new entries at it every few hours as I need to it's certainly easier 
            than manually entering data to search through the SBoM output from our systems. It's been a while since I've had to do this type of frantic dev in anger while holding down the other daily tasks to support teams, 
            but it's working (!) and providing some feedback on the company codebase, so .. yay.. win for the old man with rusty skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            I might end up forking a version of my code, tidying it a bit and providing on Github if this worm continues to help others in the same situation (be gentle, I'm tired and juggling way too much!).
        </p>
        <p>
            I admit this whole situation feels reminiscent of dealing with the early 2000's worms at the beginning of my career in I.T. As with any worm the damn thing will keep popping up on unsuspecting developer machines and making it's way around. 
            I suspect that this will linger around for quite some time, causing a headache for development, security and operational teams. There is much to learn from the incident and the nasty attack patterns it's using (the pushing to your own Github 
            repos and marking private/internal repos as public is a high-level concern for me right now), with another &quot;we have to stop using long-term auth tokens&quot; comment hanging above the whole episode for package systems around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Is anyone else frantically writing janky tooling for this at the moment ? I would imagine I'm not the only one hammering the keyboard and trying to work out ways of dealing with this type of attack.

        <h3>Another Day, Another NPM Supply Chain Attack</h3>
        <p>
            Ah yes, it's another day ending in &quot;y&quot; so it must be time for another NPM supply chain attack. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Today's list of affected NPM packages is <a href="https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised#affected-packages" target="StepSecurity">quite extensive</a> and includes some code (bundle.js injected into each package) that tries to search for credentials by pulling and using TruffleHog. A great rundown was 
            provided by <a href="https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised" target="StepSecurity">Step Security</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The new compromise is much more convoluted, and has self-propagation included to further infect packages of the maintainer utilising the infected package. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet another day that I'm having to run scanning of my company software bill of materials lists. Stay safe out there - I'm expecting more of the same as time passes with increasingly 
            complex malware bundled into the supply chain.

        <h3>Cybercrime groups down tools (for now)</h3>
        <p>
            In a post to <a href="https://breachforums.hn/" target="BreachWin">Breachforums</a>, fifteen of the more known cybercriminal groups including Scattered Spider and Lapsus$ have announced they are going dark. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The announcement comes after a season of high-level intrusions into a range of companies such as Air France, Marks &amp; Spencer and Jaguar to name but three. In recent months 
            a number of arrests have been made in relation to the groups with no update on the investigation as yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Citing that &quot;Our objectives having been fulfilled, it is now time to say goodbye.&quot; and further, &quot;The most stupid ... will enjoy our golden parachutes with the millions the group accumulated. 
            Others will keep on studying and improving systems you use in your daily lives. In silence. Others finally will just go gentle into that good night.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            As with many of the groups previously, it's likely there will be a shuffle of people, new groupings and diverging objectives. Some may hang up their tool belts and move on to new things 
            with their lives and others may continue to yearn for the excitement and addictive thrill of the next pwn. I'm sure we'll see further arrests for those splashing cash and not staying dark, 
            and as always some fallout and angry posts from disgruntled members.
        </p>
        <p>
            Time will tell what happens next, but for now it seems, things will be a modicum quieter online...
