        <h3>Kill Switch Dev gets 4 years</h3>
        <p>
           The end of employment can be a traumatic experience and humans can respond in many ways. The response 
           to their termination displays everything about their character, and for Davis Lu, a 55-year old Chinese national living 
           legally in Houston, it spoke volumes about the vindictive nature of his personality. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Davis worked for an Ohio-based company from 2007 until 2019 and after a corporate restructuring and subsequent demotion in 2018, 
            he began to embed malicious code throughout the corporate Windows environment. His malware included infinite Java thread loops designed 
            to overwhelm servers and crash production systems along with a kill switch named &quot;IsDLEnabledinAD&quot; that would automatically 
            lock all users out of their accounts if Davis's account was disabled in Active Directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Davis's employment was terminated on the 9th September 2019, the kill switch activated and caused thousands of users to be locked 
            out of their systems. The disruption in services caused the company to loose hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Davis was instructed to return his laptop as part of the termination of employment and reportedly deleted encrypted data from his device. 
            Investigators later discovered search queries on the device researching how to elevate privileges, hide processes and quickly delete files. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Having been found guilty of intentionally causing damage to protected computers earlier in the year the sentencing has now landed Davis with 
            a four-year prison sentence and then a three year supervised release following his prison term. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The case again highlights the importance of least-privilege access to systems and auditing. Humans will always react emotionally to events, but 
            the business can often protect itself and other employees with simple controls and processes. Undoubtedly, Davis's case will not be the last we 
            see hitting the news in the current uncertain climate of large business layoffs.

        <h3>UK Apple Encryption Order Reversal</h3>
        <p>
           In a sudden turnaround, the US director of national intelligence has said the UK has withdrawn it's demand to access global Apple user's data if required.
        </p>
        <p>
            In December 2024, the UK government made the demands to access encrypted data from users worldwide - effectively requesting the breaking of encryption processes and smashing security into 
            pieces on the Apple platforms. The backlash was, as expected, strong and loud. Apple responded with a &quot;We have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or 
            services, and we never will&quot; and withdrew ADP from the UK market, starting a legal proceeding to challenge the order.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst you can understand the framing of &quot;we want to ensure criminals cannot hide&quot;, the recent enforcement for age verification checks drives the narrative of 
            &quot;if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear&quot; and that, my digital friends, is a worrying cyber alleyway we do not want to end up in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether ADP makes it's way back into the UK or the court case proceeds will be one to keep an eye on over the coming months. As usual, no comment has been made in response 
            from the UK government in relation to changes in policy. The US and UK already have law enforcement agreements in place for access to data, so we might find the front door being 
            shut and the back door being opened elsewhere. 
        </p>

        <h3>Cisco FMC Vulnerability</h3>
        <p>
           Another day, another Cisco vulnerability, and this one has a critical 10.0 CVSS rating. If this were a gymnastics competition, they'd be up there on the podium this year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The CVE-2025-20265 is caused by an improper handling of user input by Firewall Management Center's RADIUS authentication subsystem during the login process. Thankfully, 
            the exploit is only possible if RADIUS authentication is configured for the web-based management interface, SSH mangement or both. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Found during internal security testing by Cisco software engineer Brandon Sakai, the issue is not known to be exploited in the real world (yet!).
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco FMC is a central management platform for products such as their firewalls, IDS, URL filtering and anti-malware tools. Attacking this central hub to other devices on 
            the corporate network is a prime target and likely to be actively prodded by foreign government groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco warned in their security bulletin &quot;An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted input when entering credentials that will be authenticated at 
            the configured RADIUS server, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands at a high privilege level.&quot; 
        </p>
        <p>
            More information on the issue is available on <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-radius-rce-TNBKf79" target="CiscoWin">Cisco's Security Advisory page</a>.

        <h3>HTTP/2 Vulnerability to Crash</h3>
        <p>
           The HTTP/2 protocol, introduced in 2012 to provide a range of improvements on the original has become the most widely used web protocol, despite the 
           newer HTTP/3 variant being released in 2019. The introduction of HTTP/2 brought a huge range of improvements on the original, however it also (as with all new software) 
           brought a range of new bugs into the world. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2023, the 'Rapid Reset' flaw brought the protocol into the limelight with the ability to DoS servers. Having undergone a patch to correct this flaw, it now appears 
            as if the patch wasn't as complete as one might hope. Security researchers Gal Bar Nahum, Anat Bremler-Barr, and Yaniv Harel have released details of a &quot;common design flaw&quot; 
            in implementations of HTTP/2 allowing the possibility of &quot;massive DoS attacks&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            CVE-2025-8671 which extends the previous CVE-2023-44487 "Rapid Reset" vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass concurrency limits which would normally prevent a server 
            from accepting requests for too much work. Rapid Reset allowed the bypass of limits by quickly cancelling a request, however in MadeYouReset they can trick the server into 
            cancelling the request on the client's behalf which bypasses the protection put in place in 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
            The vulnerability discovery partially supported by Thales' Imperva has further detail and a range of mitigation strategies 
            <a href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/madeyoureset-turning-http-2-server-against-itself/" target="ThalesSite">on their blog</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Even &quot;well-crafted&quot; requests and traffic can be used in weaponised form, it would continue to appear.

        <h3>Satellite Hacking</h3>
        <p>
           Researchers from VisionSpace Technologies displayed a range of vulnerabilities in satellite operations software at BlackHat. The team, having undertaken responsible 
           disclosure beforehand, demoed several major flaws in software used at ground stations and onbobard craft, displaying the posibility of 
           takeover or denial of service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Space is increasingly becoming a crowded and sensitive operational zone, with the cost of delivering equipment to orbit reducing each year. Communication with 
            orbital craft occurs over RF, with newer equipment undertaking key exchange for encrypted communication. It is possible it seems, however, to crash orbital platforms 
            with an unencrypted message, and then force a rotation of keys. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;So basically, you send a packet to the spacecraft, and the entire software crashes and reboots, which then actually causes the spacecraft, if it's not properly 
            configured, to reset all its keys. And then you have zero keys on the spacecraft that you can use from that stage on.&quot;, Milenko Starcik announced.
        </p>
        <p>
            The issues discovered were not solely related to craft, but also the software used for tasking such as <a href="https://visionspace.com/yamcs-v5-8-6-vulnerability-assessment/" target="visionWin1">Yamcs</a> and 
            <a href="https://visionspace.com/openc3-cosmos-a-security-assessment-of-an-open-source-mission-framework/" target="visionWin2">OpenC3Cosmos</a> which allowed 
            a range of cross-site-scripting and take control over satellite equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team's discovery has provided a range of security improvement to the operation of craft able to be updated, however it is likely that out of the thousands of orbital 
            craft in the sky, many of them will be vulnerable to a range of attack vectors. Space may or may not be the final frontier of cybersecurity, it seems.

        <h3>KLM and Air France Targeted</h3>
        <p>
           KLM and Air France have become the latest in a series of air travel companies to be targeted by cybercriminal groups attempting to access and exfiltrate critical data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The airlines who are part of the same group detected unusual activity on an external platform utilised by KLM and Air France customer service. This appears to 
            have led to unauthorised access to customer data. The security teams acted quickly to stop the unauthorised access, however the firms have not publicly specified the types of 
            data stolen, other than citing &quot;No sensitive data, such as passwords, travel details, Flying Blue miles, passport or credit card information was stolen&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            It would appear that firstname, surname and contact details have been disclosed in the breach from shared images of documents sent to customers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The airlines have advised customers to be on the alert for phishing attempts using the limited details acquired from the customer system.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's not known as yet who the perpetrator of the incident was, however it has all the hallmarks of the ShinyHunters group.

           Google has confirmed this week cybercriminals broke into one of it's Salesforce databases in June and pulled data belonging to some of it's SMB customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Threat intelligence team <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/voice-phishing-data-extortion?rev=7194ef805fa2d04b0f7e8c9521f97343" targe="GTIGwin">has admitted</a> 
            a gang associated with ShinyHunters broke into one of the corporate Salesforce instances and accessed contact information and related notes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Google advised &quot;The data retrieved by the threat actor was confined to basic and largely publicly-available business information, such as business names and contact details&quot;

        <h3>PAM Backdoor in Linux</h3>
        <p>
            A previously undocumented Linux backdoor dubbed &quot;Plague&quot; has been discovered, which apparently has evaded detection for a year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nextron Systems researcher, Pierre-Henri Pezier, <a href="https://www.nextron-systems.com/2025/08/01/plague-a-newly-discovered-pam-based-backdoor-for-linux/" target="NextronWin">noted</a> 
            &quot;The implant is built as a malicious PAM, enabling attackers to silently bypass system 
            authentication and gain persistent SSH access&quot;. Plague integrates deeply into the authentication stack, surviving system updates with minimal forensice traces.
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiple Plague artifacts were found to be uploaded to VirusTotal since July 29th 2024, however none of them were detected as being malicious by the antimalware routines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Plague has several features:
            <ul>
                <li>Antidebug, hindering analysis and reverse engineering.</li>
                <li>String obfuscation, protecting sensitive strings and offsets which complicates detection.</li>
                <li>Static password, allowing covert access for attackers.</li>
                <li>Hidden session artifacts, erasing traces of attacker activity.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Plague backdoor represents a worryingly sophisticated threat to Linux infrastructure, exploiting core auth processes to maintain stealth and persistence on the target system.

        <h3>Silent Crow Aeroflot Hack</h3>
        <p>
            The Russian national airline, Aeroflot, has had to cancel more than 40 flights due to a cyberattack on the company's IT systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a statement from the hacking group Silent Crow they claimed responsibility with the help of the Belarusian group Cyber Partisans. Posting on Telegram, Silent Crow stated 
            it's &quot;prolonged and large-scale operation...&quot; left Aeroflot &quot;completely destroyed&quot;. They went on to threaten the release of personal details of all Russians 
            who have ever flown with Aeroflot, concluding with a &quot;Glory to Ukraine! Long Live Belarus!&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            Silent Crow and Cyber Partisans have been actively engaging in cyber combat since the Russian agression, stating their hacktivist mission as &quot;fighting for the liberation of Belarus from dictatorial rule&quot;. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As with many activities behind Russian borders, it's difficult to gain accurate confirmation and assessment of claims due to the regime. How much impact this attack had on the 
            civilian populous and morale are unclear at this time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In a time when physical and cyber warfare is being engaged, the increase in civilian-based groups fighting back is only guaranteed to increase.

        <h3>Europol Shuts Down Cybercrime Forum</h3>
        <p>
            On the 22nd July as a part of a series of coordinated enforcement actions, the French Police and Paris Prosecutor in close cooperation with their 
            Ukrainian counterpart and Europol arrested the suspected administrator of xss.is, one of the world's most influential Russian-speaking cybercrime platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            With more than 50,000 registered users, it served as a key marketplace for stolen data, hacking tools and illicit services while being a central platform for 
            some of the most active and dangerous cybercriminal networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The arrest in Kyiv, Ukraine, happened after a long investigation dating back to 2021, which was initiated by the French Police. Europol provided essential operational and 
            analytical support throughout the investigation, facilitating coordination and information exchange between the French Police and Ukrainian authorities.

            Europol assisted in mapping the cybercriminal infrastructure, linking the suspect to other major threat actors. They deployed a mobile office to support French and 
            Ukrainian teams with on-site coordination and evidence collection. The seized data will be analysed to support ongoing investigations across Europe and beyond it's borders.

            The administrator of the forum was known to have a central role in enabling criminal activity alongside acting as the technical operator of the site. He is also believed to have 
            run thesecure.biz private messaging service tailored to the needs of the cybercriminal underground. It's estimated that he made around seven million euros in profit from advertising 
            and facilitation fees.

        <h3>Sharepoint Actively Exploited</h3>
        <p>
            The recently disclosed vulnerabilities for Sharepoint on-premises (CVE-2025-53770, CVE-2025-49705, CVE-2025-53771 and CVE-2025-49706) are now 
            being actively exploited by at least three Chinese groups according to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/" target="MSsecurity">reports from Microsoft's threat team</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microsoft has observed the nation-state groups Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon exploiting the vulnerabilities, targeting Internet-facing Sharepoint servers. The groups are known for 
            specifically focusing on data theft. A third actor is not as-yet known to be state-sponsored, classified as &quot;Storm-2603&quot; is continuing to be monitored. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Administrators are being warned if they have on-premises Sharepoint that has not yet been patched, it is likely the systems have been compromised. 
        </p>
        <p>
            SharePoint Server variants &quot;Subscription Edition&quot;, &quot;2019&quot;, and &quot;2016&quot; all have fixes available to download. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;In observed attacks, threat actors send a crafted POST request to the SharePoint server, uploading a malicious script named spinstall0.aspx. 
            Actors have also modified the file name in a variety of ways, such as spinstall.aspx, spinstall1.aspx, spinstall2.aspx, etc. The spinstall0.aspx 
            script contains commands to retrieve MachineKey data and return the results to the user through a GET request, enabling the theft of the key material by threat actors.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            With the disclosure and active exploits, it's likely smaller or individual groups will begin to utilise the attack vector to gain access to unpatched Sharepoint systems.

        <h3>Cisco ISE Vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>
            Cisco has issued a patch for the Identity Services Engine (ISE) and ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) that allowed unauthenticated 
            remote attackers the ability to run arbitrary code on the operating system with root privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
            CVE-2025-20337 is a 10/10 horror-fest related to CVE-2025-20281, disclosed in June and also receiving a 10/10 CVSS rating.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are no workarounds but thankfully Cisco released a software update that fixes the flaws, along with CVE-2025-20282. According to Cisco there 
            are no known exploits (yet) for any of the vulnerabilities. However, with disclosure comes a slew of &quot;research&quot; by people on both sides of the 
            ethical divide. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco's <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-unauth-rce-ZAd2GnJ6" target="ciscoWebsite">security advisory website</a> provides 
            details on affected systems and includes:
            <ul>
                <li>CVE-2025-20281 and CVE-2025-20337: These vulnerabilities affect Cisco ISE and ISE-PIC releases 3.3 and 3.4, regardless of device configuration. These vulnerabilities do not affect Cisco ISE and ISE-PIC Release 3.2 or earlier.</li>
                <li>CVE-2025-20282: This vulnerability affects only Cisco ISE and ISE-PIC Release 3.4, regardless of device configuration. This vulnerability does not affect Cisco ISE and ISE-PIC Release 3.3 or earlier.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the nature of the vulnerability, it's critical to run patching as soon as possible now the disclosure is freely available.

        <h3>Ukrainian Hackers destroy Russian Drone Maker's Network</h3>
        <p>
            According to reports on Telegram channels, the Russian Gaskar Integration plane, one of the largest suppliers of drones for the Army 
            has been taken-out by Ukranian hackers alongside the military intelligence agency, Black Owl.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Telegram post states they &quot;carried out large-scale work to capture the entire network and server infrastructure of Gaskar Group, 
            collect valuable information about the UAVs being produced and prospective, and then destroy the information and disable this infrastructure&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the statement around 47TB of technical information about the production of Russian drones was destroyed including 10TB of backup files. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Ukrainian Cyber Alliance said they also stole all of the source code before destroying everything and further reported: <br/>
            &quot; from the information we received, China is providing assistance in the production and training of specialists of Gaskar Group&quot;<br/>
            &quot;The network went down so thoroughly that the doors in the building were blocked&quot;

        <h3>NVIDIA Docker Escape</h3>
        <p>
            In a week of events we close-out with the horrifying disclosure that 37% of cloud environments are vulnerable to a flaw 
            in NVIDIA's Container Toolkit that provides attackers with root access to the host machine. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With three simple lines of code <a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/nvidia-ai-vulnerability-cve-2025-23266-nvidiascape" target="WizWin">detailed in the Wiz disclosure article</a> 
            it's possible to escape container workloads and rampage through the parent host, potentially further meddling in environments being used by other companies 
            and customers on the cloud infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The CVE, CVE-2025-23266, has been assigned a CVSS score of 9.0 (critical) and bypasses isolation measures by exploiting a subtle misconfiguration in how the toolkit 
            handles OCI hooks. Anyone with NVIDIA Continer Toolkit up to and including v1.17.7 (CDI mode only for versions prior to 1.17.5) and/or NVIDIA GPU Operator up to and including 25.3.1 is 
            vulnerable to the attack.
        </p>
        <p>
            Containers have been hailed as isolated environments that keep workloads safe, but as this continues to highlight, they are not a strong security barrier and should not be 
            relied on as the only method of workload isolation. If you are not considering a possibility of exit from your container, you could be exposing your other customers or 
            data stores to threat actors.
        </p>
        <p>
            With many hosted AI systems utilising NVIDIA Toolkits, the possibility that the system you're renting or sharing infrastructure on is compromised could be higher than you expect.
