        <h2>General Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Last of the Gen-X series to roll-off the production line and born in the heart of Teesside. A husband and father who has grown up 
            in the shadow of the threat of nuclear war, and through the birth of the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            My early days of learning were on Microcomputers ( Z80 and 6502 ) with teenage years spent on 68000 and 8086 programming. Since the early 2000's I've been working 
            in systems administration before moving into cloud infrastructure and SRE work. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Having worked in a range of areas over the years ( check out my   <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rick-trotter/29/5a1/766" target="linkwin" class="orangelink">{ LinkedIn profile }</a> ) 
            with a number of very successful projects to my name, I'm still learning daily.

        <h2>Vices and Virtues</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a sucker for anything Victorian, especially anything scientific or engineering-focused from that era. If it's steam-powered I'm usually grinning from ear-to-ear and asking 
            questions of the operators. If it's got an electronic circuit I'm often looking at the technical drawings. If it's space-related I'm making notes and seeing if there's fun 
            to be had trying to communicate with it.

        <h2>Reclusive Geek</h2>
        <p>
            I live and thrive in the Northeast of England, working remotely from my self-built Northern Operations Center for a UK Satellite Company.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been online since the early days of the Internet, lurking in the Ethernet, making friends across the planet. These days, in my older years, I'm more reclusive.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can be mainly found behind a computer terminal, or sometimes speaking in front of an audience if it means helping people out at events such as 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbZq9b5PxOc" target="_youwin" class="orangelink">{ BSides Newcastle }</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From my Northern Operations Center I support and empower teams internationally, enabling them to do the incredible.
