        <h3>NPM SBoM Check</h3>
        <p>
            The ever growing <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/ongoing-supply-chain-attack-targets-crowdstrike-npm-packages" target="SocketWin">list of compromised NPM packages</a> (thank you, Socket, for tracking this!) 
            is causing a pain to keep up with alongside work, and despite having a nice SBoM output from my dev teams, trying to manually keep up with checking was somewhat of a manual headache... especially after a huge deluge 
            of compromised items into the list.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cue several hours of scraping data from the 'net and some janky dev work on my side... 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've pulled together a very quick and dirty system with worker functions and a web interface to help keep track of my system status. With the ability to throw a CSV of new entries at it every few hours as I need to it's certainly easier 
            than manually entering data to search through the SBoM output from our systems. It's been a while since I've had to do this type of frantic dev in anger while holding down the other daily tasks to support teams, 
            but it's working (!) and providing some feedback on the company codebase, so .. yay.. win for the old man with rusty skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            I might end up forking a version of my code, tidying it a bit and providing on Github if this worm continues to help others in the same situation (be gentle, I'm tired and juggling way too much!).
        </p>
        <p>
            I admit this whole situation feels reminiscent of dealing with the early 2000's worms at the beginning of my career in I.T. As with any worm the damn thing will keep popping up on unsuspecting developer machines and making it's way around. 
            I suspect that this will linger around for quite some time, causing a headache for development, security and operational teams. There is much to learn from the incident and the nasty attack patterns it's using (the pushing to your own Github 
            repos and marking private/internal repos as public is a high-level concern for me right now), with another &quot;we have to stop using long-term auth tokens&quot; comment hanging above the whole episode for package systems around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Is anyone else frantically writing janky tooling for this at the moment ? I would imagine I'm not the only one hammering the keyboard and trying to work out ways of dealing with this type of attack.

        <h3>Another Day, Another NPM Supply Chain Attack</h3>
        <p>
            Ah yes, it's another day ending in &quot;y&quot; so it must be time for another NPM supply chain attack. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Today's list of affected NPM packages is <a href="https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised#affected-packages" target="StepSecurity">quite extensive</a> and includes some code (bundle.js injected into each package) that tries to search for credentials by pulling and using TruffleHog. A great rundown was 
            provided by <a href="https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised" target="StepSecurity">Step Security</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The new compromise is much more convoluted, and has self-propagation included to further infect packages of the maintainer utilising the infected package. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet another day that I'm having to run scanning of my company software bill of materials lists. Stay safe out there - I'm expecting more of the same as time passes with increasingly 
            complex malware bundled into the supply chain.

        <h3>Cybercrime groups down tools (for now)</h3>
        <p>
            In a post to <a href="https://breachforums.hn/" target="BreachWin">Breachforums</a>, fifteen of the more known cybercriminal groups including Scattered Spider and Lapsus$ have announced they are going dark. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The announcement comes after a season of high-level intrusions into a range of companies such as Air France, Marks &amp; Spencer and Jaguar to name but three. In recent months 
            a number of arrests have been made in relation to the groups with no update on the investigation as yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Citing that &quot;Our objectives having been fulfilled, it is now time to say goodbye.&quot; and further, &quot;The most stupid ... will enjoy our golden parachutes with the millions the group accumulated. 
            Others will keep on studying and improving systems you use in your daily lives. In silence. Others finally will just go gentle into that good night.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            As with many of the groups previously, it's likely there will be a shuffle of people, new groupings and diverging objectives. Some may hang up their tool belts and move on to new things 
            with their lives and others may continue to yearn for the excitement and addictive thrill of the next pwn. I'm sure we'll see further arrests for those splashing cash and not staying dark, 
            and as always some fallout and angry posts from disgruntled members.
        </p>
        <p>
            Time will tell what happens next, but for now it seems, things will be a modicum quieter online...

        <h3>Hackers turns 30</h3>
        <p>
            It can't be - I refuse to believe that so many years have passed under the network bridge... Okay I caught sight of my face in the mirror, yes I can. Hackers was released 30 years ago today in the 'States. 
            It was a month later on the 13th October before those of us on this side of the pond could bask in the glorious cybercopia of this cult classic. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a film that so many of us have gathered around over the years, a pop culture tongue-in-cheek snapshot of the hacking subculture in the early 1990's. Making it's way into our shared lexicon with references 
            littered around in our daily lives, I think it stands as a dividing line of ethos in the industry. It was a very different world back then, with exploration mainly for the fun and knowledge increase. The big shift 
            to financial exploitation happened post-Hackers. Yes, I know, you're going to argue AT&amp;T's timecode change was for financial gain, but it wasn't at the indiscriminant detriment to the people at large that we see today in ransomware. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thirty years of change in the industry has brought new technology, methodologies, landscapes and cultures into play and we of the older generations remember a time when things were simpler, more open and 
            maliable as protocols and systems came into being. We remember the days of pagers and dialups, with time online limited.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hackers remains in my top ten list of favourite films all these years down the line, despite it's hilarious and obvious failings, despite the avant-garde nature of it compared to the people the teams followed in real life, 
            despite the wild shoe-horning of terminology. It's the perfect imperfect film about a cultural group that was adventuring in the early digital realm. A snapshot of psyche from a different age. 
            In a year that also saw The Net released (yes, that's 30 years old this year also - no there's no secret button on my site... or is there...) and Johnny Mnemonic 
            (yes, that's also 30 years old, geez, what, did you give up your childhood memories, oh wait...) we felt as if we were on the crest of something magical. <br/>Then the mega corporations moved in to our neighbourhood... 
        </p>
        <p>
            There is much we've gained since Hackers was released, and much we have lost along the way. In a world where ZeroCool probably now works as CSO at the oil company Plague did; where Cereal Killer runs an Internet radio station (oh, wait..)
            and Burn is CISO for Apple, we all grew up watching the digital world form and evolve around us as we longed for the thrill of the adventure on hardware that is less powerful now than our washing machines and fridges.
        </p>
        <p>
            The birthday of Hackers reminds us that the ideals and goals we shaped the digital world with are still there, just under the dusty layers of piling storage mediums. Find the disk, drop it in the drive and boot up the memories 
            of what got you into all this computing business. There's a world to explore and discover - it's choice man, pure choice. This was our world, the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. -<a href="https://phrack.org/issues/7/3" target="PhrackMag">[Hacker Manifesto]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I miss the days of finding amazing items at computer faires for crazy cheap prices; I miss full tower PC's with SCSI cards and CRT's, 5.75 inch and 3.5 inch disks. I miss Zip disks and Jazz drives, chunky storage for the masses you didn't lose in your bag. I miss the 
            innovation and the eccentric devices available on the market before the time of homogeneous laptops and PC's. Before the corporate shareholders determined profits were more important than innovation and individuality. Perhaps that's why there's such a burgeoning cyberdeck community?
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to remember, in the face of a darker and more hate-filled digital domain, Hackers of the world - unite. We demanded free access to information, well that came at a price but they revoked on the deal. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So this year, on this 30th anniversary of Hackers, I'll be watching it again with a laptop and notebook. I'll be shouting &quot;Hack the Planet!&quot; appropriately all day and remembering fondly a time when BBS boards and Telnet chat sessions 
            were our communications channels. When we dreamed of having too much machine in our hands as we sat in a hacker club with electronic music blaring, coffee flowing and hardware being sold outside. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So Nintendo generation, remember to trust your technolust and rediscover the mindset of adventure, learning and excitement that the years of corporate coalface tore from our memory banks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Happy birthday, Hackers. Here's to the next 30 years together... we're elite.
        </p>

        <h3>NPM Packages Compromised</h3>
        <p>
            Due to a targeted and fortuitous phishing attack on a developer, twenty popular NPM packages were compromised and infected with malware. Prompting the 
            co-maintainer to enter MFA information, the attackers gained access to the NPM package maintainer's account.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The malware and activity was thankfully caught fairly quickly by the teams and those affected by the incident are relatively limited. The malware-laiden NPM 
            packages have been removed from the system and an analysis of downloads by teams shows a limited issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            NPM packages have a habit of being part of a chain of packages to build larger software, and this type of attack with packages used by millions of users highlights the 
            effectiveness of sidechain attacks. Thankfully, in this instance, these compromised packages were only available between 13:30 and 15:00 UTC on the 8th September before 
            the community cleaned-up the mess in the NPM packages. If your system has pulled packages in this period you are guaranteed to have been infected and are urged to update 
            packages imediately. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The issue with any chained dependancies is that your supplier or their package might have been compromised before you included other software into your development proecess. 
            Generating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a good idea to understand your software and it's dependant items. Utilising an SBOM list, you can run a simple grep for the 
            affected packages to ensure you're not including them within your chain.
        </p>

        <h3>MS BASIC Code Released</h3>
        <p>
            Microsoft have released the sourcecode for the 6502 BASIC it created way back in 1976 which was utilised by many of the early Microcomputer systems we 
            loved and grew up using such as the Commodore PET, Vic-20 and C64. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Written in Assembly language, the code includes fixes to garbage colletion the Commodore identified. Time stamps on the Github repository show commit dates from 48 years ago, with 
            comedic comments on the repository such as &quot;I see the last commit other than the license was 48 years ago. Is this project abandoned?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're playing around with 6502-based 8-bit systems, you now have a range of Assembly to tinker around with to your hearts content and fork the project.
        </p>

        <h3>Salesforce Breach</h3>
        <p>
            The vast list of companies with customer support data compromised in the recent <a href="https://trust.salesloft.com/?uid=Drift%2FSalesforce+Security+Update" target="SalesForceDrift">Salesforce Drift compromise</a> is growing and 
            includes big name brands Google, Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare and Tenable. Cloudflare has provided a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/response-to-salesloft-drift-incident/" target="CloudFlareWin">very comprehensive breakdown</a> of the incident from their 
            discovery through remediation. In a refreshingly transparent post we can see from Cloudflare's investigation a sustained probing of systems by the criminals for around ten days. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Salesloft commented on the 26th August: 
            &quot;Initial findings have shown that the actor’s primary objective was to steal credentials, specifically focusing on sensitive information like AWS access keys, passwords, 
            and Snowflake-related access tokens. We have determined that this incident did not impact customers who do not use our Drift-Salesforce integration. Based on our ongoing investigation, 
            we do not see evidence of ongoing malicious activity related to this incident.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the nature of the information stolen, however, it is more than likely the details will make their way onto the open market or be utilised for phishing or targeted campaigns against 
            customers of the brands. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Drift, the AI chat agent tooling, has been taken offline for now (one does wonder if it will return and how many people will trust it going forward). It's vital that anyone having 
            utilised it in their workflows disconnects, rotates API tokens and runs forensic analysis on their data systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Computers help humanity make terrible decisions incredibly quickly, and AI tooling, it would appear, continues to prove that it makes it more effectively and terribly than a 
            junior developer with no world experience.

        <h3>Fake NPM Package Injects Code</h3>
        <p>
           An NPM package impersonating a legitimate email library has <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodejs-smtp" target="NPM Win">been found</a> by researchers. The package 
           has thankfully now been removed from NPM with a warning.
        </p>
        <p>
            The package, nodejs-smtp, had an identical tagling, page style and README to the legitimate nodemailer package and has been available since April 2025 garnering 347 downloads since 
            it was added to the npm registry.
        </p>
        <p>
            The package uses Electron tooling to unpack Atomic Wallet's app.asar, replacing the vendor bundle with a malicious payload before repackaging the application and removing 
            process traces by deleting the working directory. The primary objective of this is to overwrite the recipient address with hard-coded wallets redirecting 
            Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP and Solana transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still operating as a mailer, it hides the underlying functionality to swipe cryptocurrency in normal operation as an SMTP maailer. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's not the first time we've seen issues with downstream pacakages in this type of attack and it won't be the last.

        <h3>South Korean Telecom Fined for terrible security</h3>
        <p>
           One for the scrapbook of &quot;what in the hell, my good man?&quot;, SK Telecom have mismanaged their network systems security so utterly terribly 
           that the watchdog has fined them $97M for their sloppy practices. The breach, disclosed back in April, led to the unauthorised access to data for almost 27 
           million subscribers. That's over half the population of South Korea (50M). Over HALF the population!
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the regulator's report, SK Telecom failed at every layer of defence and effectively rolled-out the red carpet to their own systems for the 
            cyber criminals that ran amok through their network. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Administrators had left thousands of server credentials in plaintext on a management server; there was no password protection on subscriber databases; IDS logs were not 
            reviewed by teams; 26 Million USIM authentication keys were left unencrypted in the database (leading to the ability to clone SIMS without knowledge); 
            And no response from monitoring teams on the installation of malware and exfiltration of data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The regulator provided a scathing observation &quot;The security operating environment between the internet and the internal network was managed and operated 
            in a state that was very vulnerable to illegal intrusion&quot;. Read that as corporate speak for &quot;step away from the computer, Ralf Wiggum, it's time to go eat crayons&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only slapped with a hefty fine, SK Telecom have now been ordered to implement a range of remedial items including proper encryption, tighter access controls and 
            real-time monitoring of IDS. Just a few things that any Telco should have been implementing by default, you would have imagined.
        </p>
        <p>
            Telecommunication companies are a high value target that we often only see nation-backed or heavyweight groups going after, but this incident proves the bar for 
            security is not guaranteed to start at certain levels. When you leave your networks wide open with all the goodies on the table, don't be surprised if someone walks 
            off with the food, pooch, car keys, bank cards and chaise longue. 
        </p>
        <p>
            That's enough Internets for me today.

        <h3>Microsoft Cloud Takeover Ransomware</h3>
        <p>
           Ransomware has been a continual thorn in the side of business for several years now and much of the reported incidents (not everyone does still it seems) 
           are related to systems on corporate network fleets. In a continually &quot;cloud-first&quot; narrative for business, it appears that cybercriminal groups are also chanting 
           the &quot;cloud-first&quot; mantra and evolving their attack patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microsoft's threat intelligence team have caught one of the financially-motivated groups they monitor, Storm-0501, breaking into an enterprise's on-premesis and cloud 
            environments, exfiltrating and destroying resident data before demanding a ransom to get the data back. The attack does not rely on normal malware deployment and saw 
            the enterprise contacted over their own Teams platform to demand the payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attacks seem to pivot from on-premesis systems to the cloud environment through lateral movement and privilege escalation, with the use of Evil-WinRM for remote code 
            execution. DCSync attacked Active Directory and stolen credentials were then used to target cloud-connected systems and ultimately register an Entra ID tenant owned by the 
            criminal group as a trusted federated domain, creating a backdoor to the systems. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The multi-stage processes show a determined and resourceful group with understanding in on-premesis and cloud environments with a new angle on the ransomware process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microsoft have made a change to Entra ID that aims to prevent attackers from abusing the Directory Synchronisation Accounts in attacks to escalate privileges. They also advise 
            using the Trusted Platform Module on Entra Connect Sync Server to store sensitive credentials and cryptographic keys, preventing those from being stolen by attackers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The principles of least-privilege and zero trust should be considered with these hybrid environments, and as always - MFA.

        <h3>Kill Switch Dev gets 4 years</h3>
        <p>
           The end of employment can be a traumatic experience and humans can respond in many ways. The response 
           to their termination displays everything about their character, and for Davis Lu, a 55-year old Chinese national living 
           legally in Houston, it spoke volumes about the vindictive nature of his personality. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Davis worked for an Ohio-based company from 2007 until 2019 and after a corporate restructuring and subsequent demotion in 2018, 
            he began to embed malicious code throughout the corporate Windows environment. His malware included infinite Java thread loops designed 
            to overwhelm servers and crash production systems along with a kill switch named &quot;IsDLEnabledinAD&quot; that would automatically 
            lock all users out of their accounts if Davis's account was disabled in Active Directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Davis's employment was terminated on the 9th September 2019, the kill switch activated and caused thousands of users to be locked 
            out of their systems. The disruption in services caused the company to loose hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Davis was instructed to return his laptop as part of the termination of employment and reportedly deleted encrypted data from his device. 
            Investigators later discovered search queries on the device researching how to elevate privileges, hide processes and quickly delete files. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Having been found guilty of intentionally causing damage to protected computers earlier in the year the sentencing has now landed Davis with 
            a four-year prison sentence and then a three year supervised release following his prison term. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The case again highlights the importance of least-privilege access to systems and auditing. Humans will always react emotionally to events, but 
            the business can often protect itself and other employees with simple controls and processes. Undoubtedly, Davis's case will not be the last we 
            see hitting the news in the current uncertain climate of large business layoffs.

        <h3>UK Apple Encryption Order Reversal</h3>
        <p>
           In a sudden turnaround, the US director of national intelligence has said the UK has withdrawn it's demand to access global Apple user's data if required.
        </p>
        <p>
            In December 2024, the UK government made the demands to access encrypted data from users worldwide - effectively requesting the breaking of encryption processes and smashing security into 
            pieces on the Apple platforms. The backlash was, as expected, strong and loud. Apple responded with a &quot;We have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or 
            services, and we never will&quot; and withdrew ADP from the UK market, starting a legal proceeding to challenge the order.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst you can understand the framing of &quot;we want to ensure criminals cannot hide&quot;, the recent enforcement for age verification checks drives the narrative of 
            &quot;if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear&quot; and that, my digital friends, is a worrying cyber alleyway we do not want to end up in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether ADP makes it's way back into the UK or the court case proceeds will be one to keep an eye on over the coming months. As usual, no comment has been made in response 
            from the UK government in relation to changes in policy. The US and UK already have law enforcement agreements in place for access to data, so we might find the front door being 
            shut and the back door being opened elsewhere.

        <h3>Cisco FMC Vulnerability</h3>
        <p>
           Another day, another Cisco vulnerability, and this one has a critical 10.0 CVSS rating. If this were a gymnastics competition, they'd be up there on the podium this year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The CVE-2025-20265 is caused by an improper handling of user input by Firewall Management Center's RADIUS authentication subsystem during the login process. Thankfully, 
            the exploit is only possible if RADIUS authentication is configured for the web-based management interface, SSH mangement or both. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Found during internal security testing by Cisco software engineer Brandon Sakai, the issue is not known to be exploited in the real world (yet!).
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco FMC is a central management platform for products such as their firewalls, IDS, URL filtering and anti-malware tools. Attacking this central hub to other devices on 
            the corporate network is a prime target and likely to be actively prodded by foreign government groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco warned in their security bulletin &quot;An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted input when entering credentials that will be authenticated at 
            the configured RADIUS server, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands at a high privilege level.&quot; 
        </p>
        <p>
            More information on the issue is available on <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-radius-rce-TNBKf79" target="CiscoWin">Cisco's Security Advisory page</a>.

        <h3>HTTP/2 Vulnerability to Crash</h3>
        <p>
           The HTTP/2 protocol, introduced in 2012 to provide a range of improvements on the original has become the most widely used web protocol, despite the 
           newer HTTP/3 variant being released in 2019. The introduction of HTTP/2 brought a huge range of improvements on the original, however it also (as with all new software) 
           brought a range of new bugs into the world. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2023, the 'Rapid Reset' flaw brought the protocol into the limelight with the ability to DoS servers. Having undergone a patch to correct this flaw, it now appears 
            as if the patch wasn't as complete as one might hope. Security researchers Gal Bar Nahum, Anat Bremler-Barr, and Yaniv Harel have released details of a &quot;common design flaw&quot; 
            in implementations of HTTP/2 allowing the possibility of &quot;massive DoS attacks&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            CVE-2025-8671 which extends the previous CVE-2023-44487 "Rapid Reset" vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass concurrency limits which would normally prevent a server 
            from accepting requests for too much work. Rapid Reset allowed the bypass of limits by quickly cancelling a request, however in MadeYouReset they can trick the server into 
            cancelling the request on the client's behalf which bypasses the protection put in place in 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
            The vulnerability discovery partially supported by Thales' Imperva has further detail and a range of mitigation strategies 
            <a href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/madeyoureset-turning-http-2-server-against-itself/" target="ThalesSite">on their blog</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Even &quot;well-crafted&quot; requests and traffic can be used in weaponised form, it would continue to appear.

        <h3>Satellite Hacking</h3>
        <p>
           Researchers from VisionSpace Technologies displayed a range of vulnerabilities in satellite operations software at BlackHat. The team, having undertaken responsible 
           disclosure beforehand, demoed several major flaws in software used at ground stations and onbobard craft, displaying the posibility of 
           takeover or denial of service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Space is increasingly becoming a crowded and sensitive operational zone, with the cost of delivering equipment to orbit reducing each year. Communication with 
            orbital craft occurs over RF, with newer equipment undertaking key exchange for encrypted communication. It is possible it seems, however, to crash orbital platforms 
            with an unencrypted message, and then force a rotation of keys. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;So basically, you send a packet to the spacecraft, and the entire software crashes and reboots, which then actually causes the spacecraft, if it's not properly 
            configured, to reset all its keys. And then you have zero keys on the spacecraft that you can use from that stage on.&quot;, Milenko Starcik announced.
        </p>
        <p>
            The issues discovered were not solely related to craft, but also the software used for tasking such as <a href="https://visionspace.com/yamcs-v5-8-6-vulnerability-assessment/" target="visionWin1">Yamcs</a> and 
            <a href="https://visionspace.com/openc3-cosmos-a-security-assessment-of-an-open-source-mission-framework/" target="visionWin2">OpenC3Cosmos</a> which allowed 
            a range of cross-site-scripting and take control over satellite equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team's discovery has provided a range of security improvement to the operation of craft able to be updated, however it is likely that out of the thousands of orbital 
            craft in the sky, many of them will be vulnerable to a range of attack vectors. Space may or may not be the final frontier of cybersecurity, it seems.

        <h3>KLM and Air France Targeted</h3>
        <p>
           KLM and Air France have become the latest in a series of air travel companies to be targeted by cybercriminal groups attempting to access and exfiltrate critical data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The airlines who are part of the same group detected unusual activity on an external platform utilised by KLM and Air France customer service. This appears to 
            have led to unauthorised access to customer data. The security teams acted quickly to stop the unauthorised access, however the firms have not publicly specified the types of 
            data stolen, other than citing &quot;No sensitive data, such as passwords, travel details, Flying Blue miles, passport or credit card information was stolen&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            It would appear that firstname, surname and contact details have been disclosed in the breach from shared images of documents sent to customers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The airlines have advised customers to be on the alert for phishing attempts using the limited details acquired from the customer system.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's not known as yet who the perpetrator of the incident was, however it has all the hallmarks of the ShinyHunters group.

        <h3>PAM Backdoor in Linux</h3>
        <p>
            A previously undocumented Linux backdoor dubbed &quot;Plague&quot; has been discovered, which apparently has evaded detection for a year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nextron Systems researcher, Pierre-Henri Pezier, <a href="https://www.nextron-systems.com/2025/08/01/plague-a-newly-discovered-pam-based-backdoor-for-linux/" target="NextronWin">noted</a> 
            &quot;The implant is built as a malicious PAM, enabling attackers to silently bypass system 
            authentication and gain persistent SSH access&quot;. Plague integrates deeply into the authentication stack, surviving system updates with minimal forensice traces.
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiple Plague artifacts were found to be uploaded to VirusTotal since July 29th 2024, however none of them were detected as being malicious by the antimalware routines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Plague has several features:
            <ul>
                <li>Antidebug, hindering analysis and reverse engineering.</li>
                <li>String obfuscation, protecting sensitive strings and offsets which complicates detection.</li>
                <li>Static password, allowing covert access for attackers.</li>
                <li>Hidden session artifacts, erasing traces of attacker activity.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Plague backdoor represents a worryingly sophisticated threat to Linux infrastructure, exploiting core auth processes to maintain stealth and persistence on the target system.

        <h3>Silent Crow Aeroflot Hack</h3>
        <p>
            The Russian national airline, Aeroflot, has had to cancel more than 40 flights due to a cyberattack on the company's IT systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a statement from the hacking group Silent Crow they claimed responsibility with the help of the Belarusian group Cyber Partisans. Posting on Telegram, Silent Crow stated 
            it's &quot;prolonged and large-scale operation...&quot; left Aeroflot &quot;completely destroyed&quot;. They went on to threaten the release of personal details of all Russians 
            who have ever flown with Aeroflot, concluding with a &quot;Glory to Ukraine! Long Live Belarus!&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
