        <h2>General Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Last of the Gen-X series to roll-off the production line and born in the heart of Teesside. A husband and father who has grown up 
            in the shadow of the threat of nuclear war, and through the birth of the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            My early days of learning were on Microcomputers ( Z80 and 6502 ) with teenage years spent on 68000 and 8086 programming. Since the beginning of the 2000's I've been working 
            in systems administration before moving into cloud infrastructure and SRE work. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Having worked in a range of industries over the years ( check out my   <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thecloudhacker/" target="linkwin" class="orangelink">{ LinkedIn profile }</a> ), 
            with a number of very successful projects to my name, I'm still learning daily.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my career I've had to work with a foot in security and system administration camps, so the move to a more combined DevSecOps role was inevitable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Im currently trying to re-learn a whole range of things I've forgotten, discover newer methods and tooling, and learn a plethora of topics needed to build, maintain and 
            protect systems in the space industry.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Vices and Virtues</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a sucker for anything Victorian, especially anything scientific or engineering-focused from that era. If it's steam-powered I'm usually grinning from ear-to-ear and asking 
            questions of the operators. I resonate a lot with the SteamPunk aesthetic and am certainly extremely retro-futuristic in my technology choices much to the amusement of my coworkers.
        </p>
        <p>
            If it's got an electronic circuit I'm often looking at the technical drawings or pulling it apart. If it's space-related I'm making notes and seeing if there's fun 
            to be had trying to communicate with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For my own sanity (and poops and giggles) I'm attempting to build some Commodore 64 games that have been in my head since the early 1990's. 
            I'm also building-out my own security and automation tooling to support my role and that of my team.
        </p>

        <h2>Reclusive Geek</h2>
        <p>
            I live and thrive in the Northeast of England, working remotely from my self-built Northern Operations Center for a UK Satellite Company (high resolution digital imagery, not television channels).
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been online since the early days of the Internet, making friends across the planet. These days, in my older years, I'm more reclusive and tend 
            to shy away from the public gaze and in-person interaction in favour of promoting the next generation of geeks. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I can be mainly found behind a computer terminal, or sometimes, if I'm asked by friends, speaking in front of an audience if it means helping out at events such as 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbZq9b5PxOc" target="_youwin" class="orangelink">{ BSides Newcastle }</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From my Northern Operations Center I support and empower teams internationally, enabling them to do the incredible.

        <h2>Gifting the future adventures</h2>
        <p>
            Forever interested in learning more and trying to support others with their projects, I'm often having to build-out my own home lab and test on second-hand or repurposed equipment. I'd love to 
            be in a position of being able to share more of the learning path especially with those making their first steps in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes I get asked if there are things I'm looking at to help be more creative, help with research, or generate more content. If you are interested in what I'm producing / know me and want to drop an 
            {insert season or topic} gift, or if you want to just treat a fellow geek after a lottery win, you can check out the CloudHacker tech list:
