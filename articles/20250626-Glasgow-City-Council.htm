        <h2>Glasgow City Council Suffers Cyber Attack</h2>
        <p class="dateField">26th June 2025</p>
        <p>
            On Thursday 19th June, Glasgow City Council's ICT supplier (CGI) discovered malicious activity on servers managed by a third-party supplier.  This may or may not include the theft 
            of customer data in the process. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The resulting tear-down of the affected servers for investigation has caused widespread service access issues, leading to the loss of a range of day-to-day online processes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The notification from the Council states &quot;We are conducting an investigation into the incident, alongside Police Scotland, the Scottish Cyber Coordination Centre (SC3) and the National Cyber Security Centre.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;At this stage we can't confirm whether data has actually been removed and, if so, what that data is. As a precaution, we are operating on the presumption that customer data related to the currently unavailable web forms may have been exfiltrated, 
            and we have contacted the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on this basis. No council financial systems have been affected in this attack and no details of bank accounts or credit/debit cards processed by those systems have been compromised. &quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The council services across the United Kingdom have encountered a slew of cyber attacks in recent years, with the most vulnerable in the local community the most affected.
        </p>
        <p>
            The incident again highlights the increasing popularity of side-chain attacks and the lack of security around council-run services.
