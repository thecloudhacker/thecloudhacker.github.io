        <h2>Sonicwall SMA 100 Series Vulnerability</h2>
        <p class="dateField">16th July 2025</p>
        <p>
            The Sonicwall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series (now end-of-line) provided secure remote access solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. Designed as 
            an easy-to-deploy system for those businesses that need access and security without having to have heavy technical staffing, it's likely to be dwelling in small and medium 
            business network racks in back offices across the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the fully-patched nature of the end-of-life SMA 100, a threat activity cluster (UNC6148( has been observed by 
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/sonicwall-secure-mobile-access-exploitation-overstep-backdoor" target="GoogleSecurity" >Google's Threat Intelligence Group </a> 
            targeting the devices in order to drop a backdoor called &quot;OVERSTEP&quot;. The attack seems to date back at least to October 2024, potentially due to related to CVE's from late 2023 and 2024,  
            and analysis suggests that UNC6148 may have exfiltrated credentials from the SMA appliance as early as January 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
            The backdoor appears to generate a SSL VPN session spawning a reverse shell. The overall intent appears to be to facilitate data theft and extortion operations with the potential for 
            ransomware deployment on the network inside the SMA.
        </p>
        <p>
            The nature of the compromise to the equipment requires the verification of the disk image deployed with particular attention to file system artifacts along with log and network analysis and 
            lateral movement over SSH from the SMA to other systems in your environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Organisations are advised to isolate compromised equipment, preservation of disk images and telemetry for forensics and then deployment of new images with reset credentials, OTP bindings for all local and 
            directory users on the appliance and the revoking and reissue of any certificates with private keys stored on the original appliance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Full analysis and details are found on Google's article.
