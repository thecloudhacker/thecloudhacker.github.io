        <h2>Europol Operation Eastwood</h2>
        <p class="dateField">17th July 2025</p>
        <p>
            Europol and Eurojust have completed an operation this week, named &quot;Eastwood&quot;, targeting the cybercrime network &quot;NoName057(16)&quot;. The pro-Russian cybercrime network 
            were responsible for attacks primarily focused on Ukraine, however shifted focus towards countries supporting Ukraine. Action by the group has been tracked against several European countries 
            in 2023 and 2024, mainly focused around Denial of Service attacks to public institutions and strategic sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nineteen countries were involved in the operation with two hundred police officers assigned. In total, twenty four houses were searched with two arrests and seven warrants issued. Thirteen individuals 
            have been questioned, with over one thousand supporters notified of legal liability and over one hundred servers disrupted worldwide. The major part of NoName057(16) infrastructure was taken offline in the process. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, as with the Scattered Spider arrests this last week, younger offenders were targeted by the cybercrime network. Europol explains on their operation site: 
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;To share calls to action, tutorials, updates, and to recruit volunteers, the group leveraged pro-Russian channels, forums, and even niche chat groups on social media and messaging apps. Volunteers often invited friends or contacts from gaming or hacking forums, forming small recruitment circles. These actors used platforms like DDoSia to simplify technical processes and provide guidelines, enabling new recruits to become operational quickly.<br/>
            Participants were also paid in cryptocurrency, which incentivised sustained involvement and attracted opportunists. Mimicking game-like dynamics, regular shout-outs, leader boards, or badges provided volunteers with a sense of status. This gamified manipulation, often targeted at younger offenders, was emotionally reinforced by a narrative of defending Russia or avenging political events.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the suspects are internationally listed as wanted, and in some have their identities published in the media. Five of the profiles were also published on the EU Most Wanted website. 
        </p>
