        <h2>Poland defends against power grid attack</h2>
        <p class="dateField">24th January 2026</p>
        <p>
            In the last few days of 2025, Poland's cyber command forces defended against what has been described as &quot;the largest cyber attack&quot; targeting the power grid. The minister 
            for energy, Milosz Motyka, confirmed the attack was unsuccesful and was aimed to disrupt the communication between renewable installations and the power distribution operators.
        </p>
        <p>
            Attributed to the Russian-state hacking group known as Sandworm, <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/eset-research-sandworm-cyberattack-poland-power-grid-late-2025/" target="ESETWin">ESET's report notes</a> 
            several overlaps with previous attacks. Sandworm has a long history of disruptive cyber attacks, especially since the invasion of Ukraine. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The attacks on December 29th and 30th targeted two Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, and a system enabling the management of electricity generated from renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines and photovoltaic farms. The attack 
            occurred on the tenth anniversary of Sandworm's attack on the Ukrainian power grid in 2015, which led to the deployment of the BlackEnergy malware that sent parts of the Ivano-Frankivsk region of Ukraine into darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the war rages on in Ukraine's physical world, digital systems continue to be attacked across borders and landscapes. When civilians become regular targetted casualties in the conflict, you have to seriously 
            consider when enough will be enough.
