        <h2>No Digital Ceasefire in World Conflicts</h2>
        <p class="dateField">30th June 2025</p>
        <p>
            In the wake of the tensions between Israel and Iran, the former NATO hacker, Candan Bolukbas ( CTO and founder of Black Kite ) has warned 
            &quot;In the cyber world, there's no such thing as a ceasefire&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bolukbas has raised concerns of Iran continuing to target supply chains of Israel and the U.S. DoD suppliers to find an exploitable vector in 
            retaliation to the events in the Middle East.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;My belief is that they're going to go after the supply chain, because that's our weak spot&quot; Bolukbas said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst countries may have a physical ceasefire in operation, the digital realm continues to see ongoing hostility between nations as each tries to 
            find leverage in the event of escalation.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;The US has the biggest cyber army, strategic or talent-wise, the NSA is known for having the biggest zero-day arsenal on the planet. We have a doctrine 
            on something called defense forward that says if we see something in cyberspace that can disrupt us, we're going to attack it first, and we have that under US Cyber Command's mission.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The advise to those outside the milirary trying to hold our networks and systems together? 
            <ul>
            <li>&quot;Be careful with phishing attacks, that's very common because Iran doesn't have a lot of zero days, so they go heavy on social attacks. Be careful what you're clicking on.&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;Patch your systems, including IoT for end users and residential people,&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;Patch your external-facing systems quickly, not a week or 10 days or a month later, because time is ticking from the day that the vulnerability is disclosed. Iranian groups are trying to develop an exploit.&quot;</li>
            </ul>
            &quot;If they develop the exploit before the patch, they're not going to hesitate to use that.&quot;
        </p>
