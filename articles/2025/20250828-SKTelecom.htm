        <h2>South Korean Telecom Fined for terrible security</h2>
        <p class="dateField">28th August 2025</p>
        <p>
           One for the scrapbook of &quot;what in the hell, my good man?&quot;, SK Telecom have mismanagd their network systems security so utterly terribly 
           that the watchdog has fined them $97M for their sloppy practices. The breach, disclosed back in April, led to the unauthorised access to data for almost 27 
           million subscribers. That's over half the population of South Korea (50M). Over HALF the population!
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the regulator's report, SK Telecom failed at every layer of defence and effectively rolled-out the red carpet to their own systems for the 
            cyber criminals that ran amok through their network. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Administrators had left thousands of server credentials in plaintext on a management server; there was no password protection on subscriber databases; IDS logs were not 
            reviewed by teams; 26 Million USIM authentication keys were left unencrypted in the database (leading to the ability to clone SIMS without knowledge); 
            And no response from monitoring teams on the installation of malware and exfiltration of data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The regulator provided a scathing observation &quot;The security operating environment between the internet and the internal network was managed and operated 
            in a state that was very vulnerable to illegal intrusion&quot;. Read that as corporate speak for &quot;step away from the computer, Ralf Wiggum, it's time to go eat crayons&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only slapped with a hefty fine, SK Telecom have now been ordered to implement a range of remedial items including proper encryption, tighter access controls and 
            real-time monitoring of IDS. Just a few things that any Telco should have been implementing by default, you would have imagined.
        </p>
        <p>
            Telecommunication companies are a high value target that we often only see nation-backed or heavyweight groups going after, but this incident proves the bar for 
            security is not guaranteed to start at certain levels. When you leave your networks wide open with all the goodies on the table, don't be surprised if someone walks 
            off with the food, pooch, car keys, bank cards and chaise longue. 
        </p>
        <p>
            That's enough Internets for me today.
