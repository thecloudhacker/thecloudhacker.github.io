        <h2>Discord Information leaked</h2>
        <p class="dateField">9th October 2025</p>
        <p>
            Well, well, well, if it isn't the consequences of enforced age verification decisions coming back to bite you... brace for more of this over the coming 
            weeks, months and years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discord has said around 70,000 users have had their data potentially leaked by a company that was contracted to undertake age verification. The 
            information leaked includes photographs for age verification, personal details, support team chat information and partial credit card details. So just 
            a few things to be concerned about.
        </p>
        <p>
            Affected users have been contacted by Discord and the (surprise, surprise) third-party that was connected to Discord's systems has had access removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again we see the side-chain attack in full flow with outsourced support companies failing in their duty to protect information. The list of companies 
            affected by this type of attack is growing daily.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the requirement for age verification firmly in place on many services, there is a need for the service providers to step-up their security. The 
            rush to implement providers will undoubtedly have led to cost saving at the detriment to security.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's see what the actual toll is on Discord and which provider will be the next leaky bucket.
        </p>
