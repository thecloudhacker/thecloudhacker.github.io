        <h2>Hackers turns 30</h2>
        <p class="dateField">15th September 2025</p>
        <p>
            It can't be - I refuse to believe that so many years have passed under the network bridge... Okay I caught sight of my face in the mirror, yes I can. Hackers was released 30 years ago today in the 'States. 
            It was a month later on the 13th October before those of us on this side of the pond could bask in the glorious cybercopia of this cult classic. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a film that so many of us have gathered around over the years, a pop culture tongue-in-cheek snapshot of the hacking subculture in the early 1990's. Making it's way into our shared lexicon with references 
            littered around in our daily lives, I think it stands as a dividing line of ethos in the industry. It was a very different world back then, with exploration mainly for the fun and knowledge increase. The big shift 
            to financial exploitation happened post-Hackers. Yes, I know, you're going to argue AT&amp;T's timecode change was for financial gain, but it wasn't at the indiscriminant detriment to the people at large that we see today in ransomware. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thirty years of change in the industry has brought new technology, methodologies, landscapes and cultures into play and we of the older generations remember a time when things were simpler, more open and 
            maliable as protocols and systems came into being. We remember the days of pagers and dialups, with time online limited.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hackers remains in my top ten list of favourite films all these years down the line, despite it's hilarious and obvious failings, despite the avant-garde nature of it compared to the people the teams followed in real life, 
            despite the wild shoe-horning of terminology. It's the perfect imperfect film about a cultural group that was adventuring in the early digital realm. A snapshot of psyche from a different age. 
            In a year that also saw The Net released (yes, that's 30 years old this year also - no there's no secret button on my site... or is there...) and Johnny Mnemonic 
            (yes, that's also 30 years old, geez, what, did you give up your childhood memories, oh wait...) we felt as if we were on the crest of something magical. <br/>Then the mega corporations moved in to our neighbourhood... 
        </p>
        <p>
            There is much we've gained since Hackers was released, and much we have lost along the way. In a world where ZeroCool probably now works as CSO at the oil company Plague did; where Cereal Killer runs an Internet radio station (oh, wait..)
            and Burn is CISO for Apple, we all grew up watching the digital world form and evolve around us as we longed for the thrill of the adventure on hardware that is less powerful now than our washing machines and fridges.
        </p>
        <p>
            The birthday of Hackers reminds us that the ideals and goals we shaped the digital world with are still there, just under the dusty layers of piling storage mediums. Find the disk, drop it in the drive and boot up the memories 
            of what got you into all this computing business. There's a world to explore and discover - it's choice man, pure choice. This was our world, the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. -<a href="https://phrack.org/issues/7/3" target="PhrackMag">[Hacker Manifesto]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I miss the days of finding amazing items at computer faires for crazy cheap prices; I miss full tower PC's with SCSI cards and CRT's, 5.75 inch and 3.5 inch disks. I miss Zip disks and Jazz drives, chunky storage for the masses you didn't lose in your bag. I miss the 
            innovation and the eccentric devices available on the market before the time of homogeneous laptops and PC's. Before the corporate shareholders determined profits were more important than innovation and individuality. Perhaps that's why there's such a burgeoning cyberdeck community?
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to remember, in the face of a darker and more hate-filled digital domain, Hackers of the world - unite. We demanded free access to information, well that came at a price but they revoked on the deal. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So this year, on this 30th anniversary of Hackers, I'll be watching it again with a laptop and notebook. I'll be shouting &quot;Hack the Planet!&quot; appropriately all day and remembering fondly a time when BBS boards and Telnet chat sessions 
            were our communications channels. When we dreamed of having too much machine in our hands as we sat in a hacker club with electronic music blaring, coffee flowing and hardware being sold outside. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So Nintendo generation, remember to trust your technolust and rediscover the mindset of adventure, learning and excitement that the years of corporate coalface tore from our memory banks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Happy birthday, Hackers. Here's to the next 30 years together... we're elite.
