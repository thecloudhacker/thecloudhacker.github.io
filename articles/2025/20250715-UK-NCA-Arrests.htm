        <h2>U.K. NCA Arrests four for retailer attacks</h2>
        <p class="dateField">15th July 2025</p>
        <p>
            On the 10th July, the U.K. National Crime Agency arrested four individuals in the U.K. in their investigation into the attacks on the U.K. retailers M&amp;S, Co-Op and Harrods.
        </p>
        <p>
            The NCA published an initial confirmation of the arrests on the 10th, stating:<br/>
            &quot;Two males aged 19, another aged 17, and a 20-year-old female were apprehended in the West Midlands and London this morning (10 July) on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, blackmail, money laundering and participating in the activities of an organised crime group.
            <br/>All four were arrested at their home addresses and had their electronic devices seized for digital forensic analysis.
            <br/>They remain in custody for questioning by officers from the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit in relation to the three attacks, which took place in April this year.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Details been limited  and thin on the ground with no further official updates as the investigation progresses, however Brian Krebs has 
            <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/07/uk-charges-four-in-scattered-spider-ransom-group/" target="krebWindow">posted an update</a> in which he has discovered the 
            names of two of the 19-year-old individuals: Owen David Flowers (aka bo764, Holy, and Nazi) and Thalha Jubair (aka Earth2Star and Operator).
        </p>
        <p>
            Both individuals are linked to the Scattered Spider group, with Thala also linked to LAPSUS$. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Scattered Spider is part of &quot;The Com&quot; (short for &quot;The Community&quot;), a broad collective of cybercriminals responsible for a range of crimes, including social engineering, 
            phishing, SIM swapping, extortion, sextortion, swatting, kidnapping, and murder. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The migration from online tooling hidden behind layers of obfuscation to telephone-based vectors has proved successful in recent social engineering attacks on 
            businesses, however it exposes the perpetrators to digital voiceprinting analysis. It would seem that the groups either do not care about this threat to the 
            members carrying out the social engineering, or they believe the threat to be meaningless due to their ages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The newer cybercrime groups have all been noted to target younger individuals in their teens for recruitment, with the teenagers believing it's a quick and safe 
            way to make some money. Despite their underage antics, they are increasingly discovering it's a quick way to land yourself with a visit from the NCA or FBI and a permenant record on your file. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As we await further information from the NCA, it is likely we will see continued arrests across the world in relation to the acivities of the groups.
