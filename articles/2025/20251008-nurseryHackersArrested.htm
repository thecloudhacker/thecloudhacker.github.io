        <h2>Metropolitan Police arrest suspected nursery group hackers</h2>
        <p class="dateField">8th October 2025</p>
        <p>
            The Metropolitan Police have confirmed they have arrested two 17-year-old individuals in the ongoing investigation into the 
            Kido chain nursery hack that saw the names, addresses and photographs of children and their parents stolen in late September.
        </p>
        <p>
            The hackers initially demanded a ransom of around Â£600,000 in Bitcoin to not release the details and began a campaign of contacting 
            parents in the list to have them pressurise the nursery chain. When ransom money was seen to be not forthcoming the hackers began to 
            publish the images and addresses of children in their data. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If not already calous enough in setting a nursery as a target, this act of seems to have tipped the scales heavily against the criminals 
            with the group suddenly blurring imagery on their site seemingly worried about negative reputation with other hacker groups. 
        </p>
        <p>
           On the 2nd October the hackers suddenly removed all the stolen data and pictures from their site, claiming to have deleted all 8,000 files stating &quot;No more remains and this can comfort parents&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
           Was it external pressure from other groups, concern over the backlash in the media or some flake of moral concern? As yet we'll have to speculate.
        </p>
        <p>
           The Metropolitan Police confirmed the hackers were arrested at residential addresses in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, on suspicion of computer misuse and blackmail. The investigation continues.
