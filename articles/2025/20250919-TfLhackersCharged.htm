        <h2>TfL Hackers Charged</h2>
        <p class="dateField">19th September 2025</p>
        <p>
            The National Crime Agency (NCA) in the UK <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/two-charged-for-tfl-cyber-attack" target="NCAWin">have announced</a> 
            that two men have been charged for the Transport for London (TfL) network intrusion on the 31st August 2024, believed to have been carried out by members of Scattered Spider.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thalha Jubair (19) and Owen Flowers (18) were arrested at their home addresses on Tuesday 16th September and appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court on the 18th 
            September after the Crown Prosecution Service authorised they be charged with conspiring together to commit unauthorised acts against TfL under the Computer Misuse Act.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flowers was initially arrested for the TfL attack on the 6th September 2024, whereby NCA officers identified further potential evidence of offences against US healthcare companies. 
            Flowers has therefore been also charged with conspiring with others to infiltrate and damage the networks of SSM Health Care Corporation and attempting to do the same to 
            Sutter Health's networks, both in the U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jubair has been additionally charged under RIPA for failing to disclose the pin or passwords for devices seized from him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both individuals will appear at the Crown Court on the 16th October 2025. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hannah Von Dadelszen, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS said:<br/>
            &quot;The Crown Prosecution Service has decided to prosecute Thalha Jubair and Owen Flowers with computer misuse and fraud related charges - following a National Crime Agency 
            investigation into a cyber-attack on the Transport for London network. Our prosecutors have worked to establish that there is sufficient evidence to bring the case to trial and that 
            it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings. We have worked closely with the National Crime Agency as they carried out their investigation.&quot;
