        <h2>Kill Switch Dev gets 4 years</h2>
        <p class="dateField">25th August 2025</p>
        <p>
           The end of employment can be a traumatic experience and humans can respond in many ways. The response 
           to their termination displays everything about their character, and for Davis Lu, a 55-year old Chinese national living 
           legally in Houston, it spoke volumes about the vindictive nature of his personality. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Davis worked for an Ohio-based company from 2007 until 2019 and after a corporate restructuring and subsequent demotion in 2018, 
            he began to embed malicious code throughout the corporate Windows environment. His malware included infinite Java thread loops designed 
            to overwhelm servers and crash production systems along with a kill switch named &quot;IsDLEnabledinAD&quot; that would automatically 
            lock all users out of their accounts if Davis's account was disabled in Active Directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Davis's employment was terminated on the 9th September 2019, the kill switch activated and caused thousands of users to be locked 
            out of their systems. The disruption in services caused the company to loose hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Davis was instructed to return his laptop as part of the termination of employment and reportedly deleted encrypted data from his device. 
            Investigators later discovered search queries on the device researching how to elevate privileges, hide processes and quickly delete files. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Having been found guilty of intentionally causing damage to protected computers earlier in the year the sentencing has now landed Davis with 
            a four-year prison sentence and then a three year supervised release following his prison term. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The case again highlights the importance of least-privilege access to systems and auditing. Humans will always react emotionally to events, but 
            the business can often protect itself and other employees with simple controls and processes. Undoubtedly, Davis's case will not be the last we 
            see hitting the news in the current uncertain climate of large business layoffs.
