        <h2>New AWS Crypto Miner attack</h2>
        <p class="dateField">17th December 2025</p>
        <p>
            It's been a thorn in the side for AWS-based companies for at least ten years now, and it's taken an interesting new turn. The deployment of 
            crypto mining infrastructure from exposed or stolen keys has been a vast financial sink hole for countless companies, but 
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/cryptomining-campaign-targeting-amazon-ec2-and-amazon-ecs/" target="AWSwin" >Amazon have uncovered </a>
            a new variant which has a sneaky attack mode targeting EC2 and ECS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a key has been swiped by the criminal, resources and permissions are quickly enumerated before deploying the crypto mining resources across EC2 and ECS. 
            The multi-stage attack begins with a discovery phase, running probes with the stolen IAM credentials to test permissions by using the --DryRun flag. This enables 
            the attacker to validate IAM permissions without launching infrastructure, avoiding cost increase triggers and minimising forensic evidence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The process continues with a CreateServiceLinkedRole and CreateRole phase to generate IAM roles for autoscaling groups and AWS Lambda, then attaching the 
            AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole policy. The ECS clusters deployed then register a malicious DockerHub image ( yenik65958/secret:user ) , creating a service using the 
            task definition to initiate crypto mining on ECS Fargate nodes. The DockerHub image has been thankfully taken down ( after over 100,000 pulls ), however the data 
            shows it configured to initiate a shell script on launch to start cryptocurrency mining using the RandomVIREL mining algorithm. The threat actor has also been observed 
            to exploit EC2 service quotas to maximise resource consumption with scaling between 20 and 999 instances, targeting both high-performance GPU and machine learning 
            instances as well as compute, memory and GP instances.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attack also stands out for it's use of the ModifyInstanceAttribute action to enable termination protection, preventing instances from being terminated using the 
            EC2 console, CLI or API. This action makes response to the incident more involved and shows an understanding of the standard clean-up practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amazon reccomends GuardDuty is in place and enabled on all accounts and regions with Runtime monitoring enabled, along with integration to the Security Hub. As always, 
            strong IAM controls are critically important with temporary keys instead of long-term access keys and enforced MFA on all accounts. Least privilege permissions should be 
            the default as always and ship those logs to review easily as necessary by your teams!
