        <h2>F5 Compromised</h2>
        <p class="dateField">16th October 2025</p>
        <p>
            US security company, F5, has <a href="https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000154696" target="F5win">issued a statement</a> stating it has had their systems 
            compromised and data exfiltrated. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The information taken from their systems includes a portion of the BIG-IP software codebase and vulnerability information which could lead to 
            discovery of exploits in the hardware and software provided by F5. Affected Hardware F5 products include: BIG-IP iSeries, rSeries, or any other F5 device that has reached end of support, 
            with software affected including all devices running BIG-IP (F5OS), BIG-IP (TMOS), Virtual Edition (VE), BIG IP Next, BIG- IQ, and BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes (BNK) / Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNF)
        </p>
        <p>
            F5 states: <br/>
            &quot;...we learned a highly sophisticated nation-state threat actor maintained long-term, persistent access to, and downloaded files from, certain F5 systems. These systems included our BIG-IP product development environment and engineering knowledge management platforms...&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;We have no evidence of access to, or exfiltration of, data from our CRM, financial, support case management, or iHealth systems. However, some of the exfiltrated files from our knowledge management platform contained configuration or implementation information for a small 
            percentage of customers. We are currently reviewing these files and will be communicating with affected customers directly as appropriate.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            In a change to recent global patterns of compromise, this doesn't appear to be a supply-chain attack and from their assessment appears to be a very targeted attack aimed at gaining knowledge on 
            the BIG-IP software from F5. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Management interfaces customers may have exposed to the Internet should be switced-off and the latest updates applied to systems. It is likely that F5 systems will be targeted increasingly and any 
            attack surface open to the world will be prodded to discover possible weaknesses, therefore F5 have advised utilisation of SIEM tooling to monitor activity to and from your devices.
