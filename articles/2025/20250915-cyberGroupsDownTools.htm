        <h2>Cybercrime groups down tools (for now)</h2>
        <p class="dateField">15th September 2025</p>
        <p>
            In a post to <a href="https://breachforums.hn/" target="BreachWin">Breachforums</a>, fifteen of the more known cybercriminal groups including Scattered Spider and Lapsus$ have announced they are going dark. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The announcement comes after a season of high-level intrusions into a range of companies such as Air France, Marks &amp; Spencer and Jaguar to name but three. In recent months 
            a number of arrests have been made in relation to the groups with no update on the investigation as yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Citing that &quot;Our objectives having been fulfilled, it is now time to say goodbye.&quot; and further, &quot;The most stupid ... will enjoy our golden parachutes with the millions the group accumulated. 
            Others will keep on studying and improving systems you use in your daily lives. In silence. Others finally will just go gentle into that good night.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            As with many of the groups previously, it's likely there will be a shuffle of people, new groupings and diverging objectives. Some may hang up their tool belts and move on to new things 
            with their lives and others may continue to yearn for the excitement and addictive thrill of the next pwn. I'm sure we'll see further arrests for those splashing cash and not staying dark, 
            and as always some fallout and angry posts from disgruntled members.
        </p>
        <p>
            Time will tell what happens next, but for now it seems, things will be a modicum quieter online...
