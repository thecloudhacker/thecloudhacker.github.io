        <h2>Europol Shuts Down Cybercrime Forum</h2>
        <p class="dateField">24th July 2025</p>
        <p>
            On the 22nd July as a part of a series of coordinated enforcement actions, the French Police and Paris Prosecutor in close cooperation with their 
            Ukrainian counterpart and Europol arrested the suspected administrator of xss.is, one of the world's most influential Russian-speaking cybercrime platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            With more than 50,000 registered users, it served as a key marketplace for stolen data, hacking tools and illicit services while being a central platform for 
            some of the most active and dangerous cybercriminal networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The arrest in Kyiv, Ukraine, happened after a long investigation dating back to 2021, which was initiated by the French Police. Europol provided essential operational and 
            analytical support throughout the investigation, facilitating coordination and information exchange between the French Police and Ukrainian authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Europol assisted in mapping the cybercriminal infrastructure, linking the suspect to other major threat actors. They deployed a mobile office to support French and 
            Ukrainian teams with on-site coordination and evidence collection. The seized data will be analysed to support ongoing investigations across Europe and beyond it's borders.
        </p>
        <p>
            The administrator of the forum was known to have a central role in enabling criminal activity alongside acting as the technical operator of the site. He is also believed to have 
            run thesecure.biz private messaging service tailored to the needs of the cybercriminal underground. It's estimated that he made around seven million euros in profit from advertising 
            and facilitation fees.
