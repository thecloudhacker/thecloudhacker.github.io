        <h2>Claude AI used for cyber espionage</h2>
        <p class="dateField">14th November 2025</p>
        <p>
           In a <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf">security report from Anthropic</a>  the first catalogued usage of AI tools 
           to attempt access to over thirty high-profile companies and government organisations. In some cases, the attacks was successful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traced-back to a Chinese state-sponsored group, the attackers used Claude Code and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to run the attacks without a human in the tactical execution loop. 
            A human-developed framework utilised Claude to orchestrate multi-stage attacks, which were then in-turn carried out by several Claude sub-agents, all performing specific tasks. 
            Once the sub-agents had developed exploit chains and their associated custom payloads, human operators spent between two and ten minutes reviewing the results of the AI's actions, then signing-off on the subsequent exploitations.
            The sub-agents ran to find and validate credentials, escalate privileges, moving laterally across the network, accessing and then stealing sensitive data. Post-exploitation, the human operator only had to again review the AI's 
            work before approving the final data exfiltration.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;While we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale&quot; states Anthropic's new analysis. As with standard AI, it &quot;requently overstated findings and occasionally 
            fabricated data during autonomous operations&quot;. So, it's not just normal development teams suffering from the cocky and erroneous &quot;I'm amazing!&quot; responses from AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            It may be the first documented case, but with the rise of automated systems it is unlikely to be the solitary example in the news.
