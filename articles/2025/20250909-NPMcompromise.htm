        <h2>NPM Packages Compromised</h2>
        <p class="dateField">9th September 2025</p>
        <p>
            Due to a targeted and fortuitous phishing attack on a developer, twenty popular NPM packages were compromised and infected with malware. Prompting the 
            co-maintainer to enter MFA information, the attackers gained access to the NPM package maintainer's account.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The malware and activity was thankfully caught fairly quickly by the teams and those affected by the incident are relatively limited. The malware-laiden NPM 
            packages have been removed from the system and an analysis of downloads by teams shows a limited issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            NPM packages have a habit of being part of a chain of packages to build larger software, and this type of attack with packages used by millions of users highlights the 
            effectiveness of sidechain attacks. Thankfully, in this instance, these compromised packages were only available between 13:30 and 15:00 UTC on the 8th September before 
            the community cleaned-up the mess in the NPM packages. If your system has pulled packages in this period you are guaranteed to have been infected and are urged to update 
            packages imediately. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The issue with any chained dependancies is that your supplier or their package might have been compromised before you included other software into your development proecess. 
            Generating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a good idea to understand your software and it's dependant items. Utilising an SBOM list, you can run a simple grep for the 
            affected packages to ensure you're not including them within your chain.
        </p>
