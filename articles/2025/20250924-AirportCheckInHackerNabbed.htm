        <h2>European Airport Hacker Nabbed by NCA</h2>
        <p class="dateField">24th September 2025</p>
        <p>
            The National Crime Agency have arrested a man in West Sussex in connection with the European airport system hack that brought air travel to 
            a grinding halt at the weekend and continues to cause issues into this week.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attack against the Collins Aerospace technology check-in system caused widespread issues, travel problems and delays across Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Officers from the NCA supported by the regional crimes unit arrested the man in his 40's on Tuesday evening on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences. 
            He has subsequently been released on conditional bail.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing.&quot; said NCA deputy director, 
            Paul Foster (head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit). &quot;Cybercrime is a persistent global threat that continues to cause significant disruption to the UK. 
            Alongside our partners here and overseas, the NCA is committed to reducing that threat in order to protect the British public&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The investigation into the inicident continues with no specific cybercriminal gang claiming responsibility for the action as yet. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As reiterated many times over the course of recent incidents, this sort of attack will continue and persistently prove that infrastructure is vulnerable to outside 
            influences and attack. We will no doubt hear of further results from the investigation in due course.
        </p>
