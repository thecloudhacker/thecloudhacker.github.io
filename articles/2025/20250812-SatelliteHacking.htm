        <h2>Satellite Hacking</h2>
        <p class="dateField">12th August 2025</p>
        <p>
           Researchers from VisionSpace Technologies displayed a range of vulnerabilities in satellite operations software at BlackHat. The team, having undertaken responsible 
           disclosure beforehand, demoed several major flaws in software used at ground stations and onbobard craft, displaying the posibility of 
           takeover or denial of service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Space is increasingly becoming a crowded and sensitive operational zone, with the cost of delivering equipment to orbit reducing each year. Communication with 
            orbital craft occurs over RF, with newer equipment undertaking key exchange for encrypted communication. It is possible it seems, however, to crash orbital platforms 
            with an unencrypted message, and then force a rotation of keys. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;So basically, you send a packet to the spacecraft, and the entire software crashes and reboots, which then actually causes the spacecraft, if it's not properly 
            configured, to reset all its keys. And then you have zero keys on the spacecraft that you can use from that stage on.&quot;, Milenko Starcik announced.
        </p>
        <p>
            The issues discovered were not solely related to craft, but also the software used for tasking such as <a href="https://visionspace.com/yamcs-v5-8-6-vulnerability-assessment/" target="visionWin1">Yamcs</a> and 
            <a href="https://visionspace.com/openc3-cosmos-a-security-assessment-of-an-open-source-mission-framework/" target="visionWin2">OpenC3Cosmos</a> which allowed 
            a range of cross-site-scripting and take control over satellite equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team's discovery has provided a range of security improvement to the operation of craft able to be updated, however it is likely that out of the thousands of orbital 
            craft in the sky, many of them will be vulnerable to a range of attack vectors. Space may or may not be the final frontier of cybersecurity, it seems.
