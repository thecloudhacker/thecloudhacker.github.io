        <h2>OpenAI boots suspected Chinese Gov accounts from ChatGPT</h2>
        <p class="dateField">7th October 2025</p>
        <p>
            OpenAI published an <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/threat-intelligence-reports/7d662b68-952f-4dfd-a2f2-fe55b041cc4a/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai-october-2025.pdf" target="openAIwin">intelligence report</a> 
            stating it has banned ChatGPT accounts it believes to be linked to Chinese government entities attempting to use AI models to generate 
            surveillance software.
        </p>
        <p>
            The users, now banned, were suspected to be utilising a VPN service to access the AI software from China. In one account, their requests to the AI models  
            were seen to be asking it to design promotional materials and project plans for a social media listening tool, described as a &quot;probe&quot; that could 
            scan X, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok and YouTube for what the user described as extermist speech, ethnic, religious and political content.
        </p>
        <p>
            The principal investigator on OpenAI's intelligence and investigations team said 
            &quot;What we saw and banned in those cases was typically threat actors asking ChatGPT to help put together plans or documentation for AI-powered tools, but not then to implement them.&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company also banned one user who asked ChatGPT to identify funding sources for an X account that criticised the Chinese government, and another who asked ChatGPT to identify organizers of a petition in Mongolia
        </p>
        <p>
            Michael Flossman, who leads OpenAI's threat intelligence team said &quot;One China-linked cluster that we investigated, for example, used ChatGPT to draft phishing lures and then explored another model, DeepSeek, to automate mass targeting,&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
           China isn't alone in being banned as OpenAI has also seen system abuse originating from Russia asking the model to develop and refine malware, including remote access tojans, 
           credential stealers and features to help malware evade detection.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI is a growing concern for data exfiltration and as a weaponised tool allowing those who would normally be incapable of generating malware and campaigns the means to 
            quickly and easily generate systems. We can only hope that the teams continue to implement stronger guard-rails and keep on top of security issues as we get to grips with 
            the automated future we've released on ourselves.
