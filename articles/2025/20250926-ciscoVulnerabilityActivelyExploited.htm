        <h2>Cisco Vulnerbility Actively Exploited</h2>
        <p class="dateField">26th September 2025</p>
        <p>
            The recently disclosed Cisco Vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-20333 and CVE-2025-20362) allowing access to endpoints and execution of code is now 
            being actively exploited to deploy malware components such as LINE VIPER and RayInitiator, the 
            <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/persistent-malicious-targeting-cisco-devices" target="NCSCWin">NCSC have stated</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cisco have warned vendors that &quot;"Attackers were observed to have exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities and employed advanced evasion techniques such as disabling logging, intercepting CLI commands, 
            and intentionally crashing devices to prevent diagnostic analysis&quot;. There have been noted incidents where ROMMON has been modified to persist modifications after a reboot or software update.
        </p>
        <p>
            ASA 5500-X Series models running Cisco ASA Software releases 9.12 or 9.14 with VPN web services enabled, and which do not support Secure Boot and Trust Anchor technologies have been compromised 
            in this latest vulnerability attack. All of the affected devices have reached end-of-support (EoS) or are about to reach EoS status by next week including:<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>5512-X</li>
                <li>5515-X</li>
                <li>5525-X</li>
                <li>5545-X</li>
                <li>5555-X</li>
                <li>5585-X</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            NCSC are urging network vendors to verify their traffic and systems, remediate through patching and potentially replace anything that is heading to EoL. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;It is critical for organisations to take note of the recommended actions highlighted by Cisco today, particularly on detection and remediation&quot;, said 
            Ollie Whitehouse, the NCSC CTO. &quot;We strongly encourage network defenders to follow vendor best practices and engage with the NCSC's malware analysis report to assist with their investigations.<br/>
            End-of-life technology presents a significant risk for organisations. Systems and devices should be promptly migrated to modern versions to address vulnerabilities and strengthen resilience.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the wide usage of the devices it is likely that we'll see an increase in compromise reports over the coming weeks.
