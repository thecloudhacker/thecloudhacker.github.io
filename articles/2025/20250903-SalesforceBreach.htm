        <h2>Salesforce Breach</h2>
        <p class="dateField">3rd September 2025</p>
        <p>
            The vast list of companies with customer support data compromised in the recent <a href="https://trust.salesloft.com/?uid=Drift%2FSalesforce+Security+Update" target="SalesForceDrift">Salesforce Drift compromise</a> is growing and 
            includes big name brands Google, Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare and Tenable. Cloudflare has provided a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/response-to-salesloft-drift-incident/" target="CloudFlareWin">very comprehensive breakdown</a> of the incident from their 
            discovery through remediation. In a refreshingly transparent post we can see from Cloudflare's investigation a sustained probing of systems by the criminals for around ten days. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Salesloft commented on the 26th August: 
            &quot;Initial findings have shown that the actorâ€™s primary objective was to steal credentials, specifically focusing on sensitive information like AWS access keys, passwords, 
            and Snowflake-related access tokens. We have determined that this incident did not impact customers who do not use our Drift-Salesforce integration. Based on our ongoing investigation, 
            we do not see evidence of ongoing malicious activity related to this incident.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the nature of the information stolen, however, it is more than likely the details will make their way onto the open market or be utilised for phishing or targeted campaigns against 
            customers of the brands. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Drift, the AI chat agent tooling, has been taken offline for now (one does wonder if it will return and how many people will trust it going forward). It's vital that anyone having 
            utilised it in their workflows disconnects, rotates API tokens and runs forensic analysis on their data systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Computers help humanity make terrible decisions incredibly quickly, and AI tooling, it would appear, continues to prove that it makes it more effectively and terribly than a 
            junior developer with no world experience.
