        <h2>Microsoft Cloud Takeover Ransomware</h2>
        <p class="dateField">28th August 2025</p>
        <p>
           Ransomware has been a continual thorn in the side of business for several years now and much of the reported incidents (not everyone does still it seems) 
           related to systems on corporate network fleets. In a continually &quot;cloud-first&quot; narrative for business, it appears that cybercriminal groups are also chanting 
           the &quot;cloud-first&quot; mantra and evolving their attack patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microsoft's threat intelligence team have caught one of the financially-motivated groups they monitor, Storm-0501, breaking into an enterprise's on-premesis and cloud 
            environments, exfiltrating and destroying resident data before demanding a ransom to get the data back. The attack does not rely on normal malware deployment and saw 
            the enterprise contacted over their own Teams platform to demand the payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attacks seem to pivot from on-premesis systems to the cloud environment through lateral movement and privilege escalation, with the use of Evil-WinRM for remote code 
            execution. DCSync attacked Active Directory and stolen credentials were then used to target cloud-connected systems and ultimately register an Entra ID tenant owned by the 
            criminal group as a trusted federated domain, creating a backdoor to the systems. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The multi-stage processes show a determined and resourceful group with understanding in on-premesis and cloud environments with a new angle on the ransomware process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microsoft have made a change to Entra ID that aims to prevent attackers from abusing the Directory Synchronisation Accounts in attacks to escalate privileges. They also advise 
            using the Trusted Platform Module on Entra Connect Sync Server to store sensitive credentials and cryptographic keys, preventing those from being stolen by attackers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The principles of least-privilege and zero trust should be considered with these hybrid environments, and as always - MFA.
