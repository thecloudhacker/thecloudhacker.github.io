        <h2>The Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Hokey Cokey</h2>
        <p class="dateField">13th October 2025</p>
        <p>
            You put your hack crew in, you take your hack crew out, in out, in out, rattle sabres all about...
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, the hokey cokey... they're in they're out, they're back, they're scattering into the dark... it's the unusual and confusing world 
            of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters group where they come out of retirement to head back into it again. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems the group are having some tête-à-tête with the FBI after recent high-level attacks on systems and subsequent arrests and investigations. Formed 
            as an amalgamation of key members from Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and Shiny Hunters, the group has come under scrutiny again due to recent data drops from companies including Qantas, 
            Vietnam Airlines, Gap, and Fujifilm.
        </p>
        <p>
            The group stated in their usual &lt;sarcasm&gt;charming&lt;/sarcasm&gt; way:<br/>
            &quot;As per the exceptional circumstances by which the FBI tried to obliterate our legacy, we've exceptionally decided to 
            temporarily renounce to oblivion ... and promptly hack them back ... We shall now dissolve again in the ether. Good night.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            As with all of the groups, there will be internal politics and power struggles along with grudges against agencies and personnel. How this plays out over 
            the next few months will be seen in time, but for now, perhaps, maybe, possibly, they're hiding in the dark corners again - watching, waiting, listening.. 
            (trolls reference, get it, trolls.. urgh, I'm wasted on this generation).
