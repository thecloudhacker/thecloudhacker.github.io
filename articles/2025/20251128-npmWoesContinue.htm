        <h2>NPM Woes Continue</h2>
        <p class="dateField">28th November 2025</p>
        <p>
            I'd like to say this was just the Annus Horribilis for Node Package Manager, but I fear this is just the shape of things to come for the forseeable future. In today's 
            ongoing saga of issues, North Korean threat actors behind the Contagious Interview campaign spammed the npm registry with 197 more malicious packages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team at <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/north-korea-contagious-interview-npm-attacks" target="SocketWin">Socket</a> have been tracking the progress of the 
            npm attacks which are designed to deliver a variant of OtterCookie. Once launched, the software attempts to evade any sandboxes and virtual machines, profiles the machine 
            and establishes a command and control channel to provide the attackers with a remote shell, along with the ability to steal clipboard contents, log keystrokes, capture 
            screenshots, gather browser credentials, documents, cryptocurrency wallet data and seed phrases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The utilisation of these types of package attacks are likely to cause significant damage as they are being coupled with fake interview processes, a recent tactic to get 
            developers to install and run code on their systems in the hope of completing technical assessment to secure a new role. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's that time of year whereby people consider where they're heading in their career and starting to look elsewhere - just the ideal time for the threat actors to 
            pretend to be a recruitment agency and have developers install malware. If that's undertaken on workplace machines, it might cause significant compromise or data theft 
            at a time when teams are trying to wind-down for the holidays.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll have to see what further npm headlines appear in the first few months of 2026.
